	<h2>Data Science</h2>
	<p>
		Exploration and quantitative analysis of all available structured and unstructured data to develop understanding, extract knowledge, and formulate actionable results.
	</p>
	<ul>Types of algorithms:
		<li>Classification: Predict if a customer will churn or not</li>
		<li>Regression</li>
		<li>Clustering</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Classification</h2>
	<p>There are several algorithms available. </p>
	<p>The performance consider the following elements:
		<ul>
			<li><b>Confusion Matrix</b>:
				<ul>
					<li>True Positives (TP): True positives are the cases when the actual class of the data point was 1(True) and the predicted is also 1(True), e.g. positive well-being with predicted positive well-being or predicting churn and in the actual values there is a churn. Predict positive well-being and the true value is positive.
					<li>True Negatives: True negatives are the cases when the actual class of the data point was 0(False) and the predicted is also 0 (False), e.g. negative well-being with predicted negative well-being or predicting that a customer dropout and in really he didn't.</li>
					<li>False Positives: False positives are the cases when the actual class of the data point was 0(False) and the predicted is 1(True), e.g. predicted positive well-being with negative well-being or predict a customer dropout and the customer is retained.</li>
					<li>False Negative: Predicted wrongly FALSE and the predicted value is 0 when in reality is 1, e.g. predict well-being negative when is positive.o
