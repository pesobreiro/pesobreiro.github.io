<p>
When the IBM WebSphere UDDI Registry is running,
it might issue messages to report events
or errors.
You can use these messages, described in <a href="messages.html#messages">Messages</a>
as your first aid to problem determination.
If you need more details about the causes of a problem, you can turn on tracing for
UDDI, as described in <a href="#trace">Turning on UDDI trace</a>.

<H3><A href="#TOC21" name="trace">Turning on UDDI trace</A></H3>
<!-- <P>If errors occur, you may need to turn on
tracing for UDDI, in order to collect additional
diagnostic information. The simplest way
to enable trace for the whole of the IBM
WebSphere UDDI Registry is as follows:
<OL>
  <LI>From the WebSphere Administrative Console's
  action bar, select <B>Console... -&gt; Trace... -&gt; Trace Settings</B> and fill in a trace string of <I>com.ibm.uddi.*</I>.
  <LI>Click &quot;Apply&quot;
  <LI>Select <B>Console... -&gt; Trace... -&gt; Enabled</B> and ensure that enabled is checked.
  <P>This will cause UDDI trace records to be
  written to the WebSphere trace file (if no
  trace file has been defined, output will
  be to the Default_Server_stdout.log).</P>
</OL> --> 
<P>On the WebSphere Application Server AE:<BR></P>
<OL>
  <LI>On the Administrative Console, in the tree
  on the left hand side, go to <B>Nodes... -&gt; machine name... -&gt; Application
  Servers... -&gt; Default Server</B> (or whichever server you wish to enable
  trace on).
  <LI>Go to the &quot;Services&quot; tab, select
  &quot;Trace Service&quot; and press &quot;Edit
  Properties&quot;.
  <LI>Press the elipsis &quot;...&quot; button
  next to &quot;Trace specification&quot;.
  This gives you a tree of components and
  groups
  from which you can select the ones you
  wish
  to trace.
  <P>For example, select <B>Components -&gt; com -&gt; ibm -&gt; UDDI
  </B>and you should see the following components
  to choose from</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>api **
    <LI>config **
    <LI>dom **
    <LI>ejb
    <LI>gui **
    <LI>persistence **
    <LI>ras
    <LI>soap **
    <LI>uuid **
    <P>** <B>Important note</B> - Please note that if you have just started
    the Default Server and UDDI Registry
    application,
    but have not run any GUI or API activities,
    you will only see the ejb and ras components.
    The other components are visible only
    once
    some API activity or GUI activity occurs.
    As such, if you wish to selectively trace
    any of these activities, you must run
    some
    API or GUI activity.</P>
    <P>You will also see, under the Trace Groups,
    a UDDI trace group, and within that the various
    UDDI components (as with the components view,
    only ras and ejb are visible after a restart
    of the system).</P>
  </UL>
  <LI>Right-click on the component/group you want
  to trace and choose the trace level. Press
  &quot;<B>OK</B>&quot;.
  <P>Note that if you want to trace all components
  in the UDDI, right click on uddi and choose
  the trace level you want.</P>
  <LI>You can optionally specify the file you want
  the trace to be written to. Select the specify
  radio button and the path and trace file
  name that the output will be written to.
  This file must already exist.
  <LI>Press &quot;<B>OK</B>&quot;.
  <LI>Press &quot;<B>Apply</B>&quot; - it is imperitive you do this step.
  <LI>Go to the <B>Console... -&gt; Trace</B> menu and click &quot;Enable Trace&quot;.
  <LI>Stop and restart the default server (or whichever
  server you require).
</OL>
<P>Once you have traced the activities you want,
you can turn trace off again as follows:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Go to the <B>Console -&gt; Trace</B> menu and click &quot;Enable Trace&quot;
  again which will disable trace and uncheck
  the entry.
  <LI>Turn off the trace options you had previously
  selected by (for example) going to
  <UL>
    <LI><B>Select Components -&gt; com -&gt; ibm -&gt;
    UDDI</B>
    <LI>right click on uddi, and select 'none'. This
    will turn off all tracing for UDDI components.
  </UL>
  <LI>Press '<B>OK</B>'
  <LI>Press '<B>Apply</B>' - it is imperitive you do this step
</OL>
<P>The tracing is now stopped.</P>
