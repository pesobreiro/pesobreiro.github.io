Message Reference for IBM WebSphere UDDI Registry SOAP Interface</h3>  
 
<hr>
<p><a NAME="UDSP0001"></a><b>UDSP0001E: ParserPool found empty while attempting to process request. Request unsatisfied.</b>
<br><b>Explanation: </b>A SOAP request was received, but was unable to be dealt with, as there were no free Parsers within the ParserPool.
<br><b>User Response: </b>Consider increasing the number of Parsers within the ParserPool by modifying the Init Parameter on the SOAP servlets.
<hr>
<p><a NAME="UDSP0002"></a><b>UDSP0002E: Error locating schemas required for UDDI processing. SOAP Servlets unworkable.</b>
<br><b>Explanation: </b>The SOAP servlet was unable to locate the schemas it requires in order to process SOAP requests. Without these, the servlet cannot process SOAP requests.
<br><b>User Response: </b>Check installation of UDDI was performed correctly. If the error persists,
examine the WebSphere logs for information on its cause.  If the problem
cannot be resolved, then please contact the IBM Customer Service Center.
<hr>
<p><a NAME="UDSP0003"></a><b>UDSP0003W: Servlet unable to locate init parameter 'defaultPoolSize'. Using internal defaults.</B>
<br><b>Explanation: </b>The SOAP servlet was unable to locate the init parameter which sets the default size of the ParserPool. It will fall back to an internal default.
<br><b>User Response: </b>If this message occured after attempting to make changes to the defaultPoolSize init paramerter, ensure the changes were correct. If this message has appeared after installed, ensure installation was performed correctly.
<hr>
<p><a NAME="UDSP0004"></a><b>UDSP0004W: Servlet unable to understand init parameter 'defaultPoolSize'. Using internal defaults.</b>
<br><b>Explanation: </b>The SOAP servlet was unable to parse the init parameter which sets the default size of the ParserPool. It will fall back to an internal default.
<br><b>User Response: </b>If this message occured after attempting to make changes to the defaultPoolSize init paramerter, ensure the changes were correct. If this message has appeared after installed, ensure installation was performed correctly.
<hr>
<p><a NAME="UDSP0005"></a><b>UDSP0005E: Error occurred during parser creation.</b>
<br><b>Explanation: </b>An unspecified error occured during the creation of a SOAP parser.

examine the WebSphere logs for information on its cause.  If the problem
cannot be resolved, then please contact the IBM Customer Service Center.
<hr>
<p><a NAME="UDSP0006"></a><b>UDSP0006E: Internal configuration error.</b>
<br><b>Explanation: </b>This error may occur if there was a failure creating a Parser, with accompanying message UDSP0005. It may also occur if there was a problem acquiring the Persistance layer.
<br><b>User Response: </b>Restart the UDDI registry.  If the error persists,
examine the WebSphere logs for information on its cause.  If the problem
cannot be resolved, then please contact the IBM Customer Service Center. 
<hr>
<p><a NAME="UDSP0007"></a><b>UDSP0007E: Error during servlet acquisition of persistence layer.</b>
<br><b>Explanation: </b>The SOAP servlet was unable to acquire the persistance layer required for it to communicate with the UDDI datasource.
<br><b>User Response: </b>Restart the UDDI registry.  If the error persists,
examine the WebSphere logs for information on its cause.  If the problem
cannot be resolved, then please contact the IBM Customer Service Center.
