<P>This topic describes the layout of the UDDI
user console, also referred to as the Graphical
User Interface (GUI), which you can use to
act on the IBM WebSphere UDDI Registry.<p>
For information about how to display the UDDI user console, see
<a href="displayuc.html#displayuc">Displaying the user console</A>.</p>
<P>If you want to use multiple languages from
the User Console, then please refer to the
section on &quot;<A href="configure.html#guiprops">Configuring the UDDI User Console for multiple
language encoding support</A>&quot;.</P>
<P>The UDDI user console is split into three
distinct areas. At the top of the screen
are buttons which activate various functions
in the areas below this bar. These buttons
are:</P>
<DL>
  <DT>Home
  <DD>- returns you to the IBM WebSphere UDDI Registry
  welcome page
  <DT>Find
  <DD>- activates the Find Tab on the banner below
  to the left
  <DT>Publish
  <DD>- similarly activates the Publish Tab on
  the banner below to the left
</DL>
<p>Below the WebSphere UDDI Registry banner
the screen is split into two parts. On the
left are the two Tabs mentioned above, the
Find and Publish Tabs.
<H4>Find Tab</H4>
<P>The Find Tab is in two parts. At the top
a <B>Quick Find</B> service is provided. There are three radio
buttons to enable choices between 'Service',
'Business' and 'Servicetype' finds. Below
these radio buttons is a panel for entering
the search criteria and, beneath this, a
blue 'Find' button to start the search. Comments
are provided to show the user the wildcard
character.</P>
<P>Beneath the Quick Find is an <B>Advanced Find</B> function which enables the user to be more
specific in the search criteria. The resultant
panel on the right shows a form which the
user may enter search criteria. There are
two places to start the search (mid-way down
and at the bottom of the form). The <B>Locator</B> field has a button (marked in blue with
the words &quot;<B>Show category tree</B>&quot;) which defines the tree from which
the user can select categories (or taxonomies).
This is shown in the left hand panel.</P>
<P>The results of clicking on the <B>Find</B>&nbsp;button or the <B>Advanced Find</B> buttons (in the lower section) are shown
on the panel to the right which is the detail
panel.</P>
<H4>Publish Tab</H4>
The <I>Publish</I> button on the top banner activates the Publish
tab in the same area.
<P>The Publish Tab is split into three distinct
sections. The top part is a <B>Quick Publish</B> section to allow the user to Publish a Business
or Service Type by name only.</P>
<P>For a more detailed service, use the <B>Advanced Publish</B> section below this. The comments below each
button ('Add a business' and 'Add a Servicetype')
describe individual functions. As in the
Advanced Find functions above, there are
two places to Publish your business or service
type (one towards the top of the form and
the other at the bottom). Similarly the <B>Locator</B> field allows taxonomies to be shown in the
left panel from which the user can select
categories.</P>
<P>Below the Advanced Publish section is a <B>Registered Information</B> section to show the businesses, services
and service types registered to the individual
user. From the resultant details shown in
the right hand pane, users can <B>Edit </B>or <B>Delete</B> entities owned by them in the <B>Actions</B>&nbsp;boxes, or <B>Show/Add Services</B> in the <B>Services</B> box.</P>
<P>As in the Find Tab, the results of clicking
on and of the Publish buttons is showed in
the panel to the right (the detail panel).</P>
