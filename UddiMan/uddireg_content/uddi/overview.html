<P>The Universal Description, Discovery and
Integration (UDDI) specification defines
a way to publish and discover information
about Web Services. The term 'Web service'
describes specific business functionality
exposed by a company, usually through an
Internet connection, to allow another company,
or its subsidiaries, or software program
to use the service.</p>
<H3><A name="ubr">Universal Business Registries (IBM UBR)</A></H3>
<p>The IBM Universal Business Registry is one
of a group of web-based registries that expose
information about a business or other entity
and its technical interfaces (or APIs). These
registries are run by multiple Operator Sites,
and can be used by anyone who wants to make
information available about one or more businesses
or entities, as well as anyone that wants
to find that information. Although there
are Universal Business Registries (sometimes
referred to as 'public UDDI registries')
hosted worldwide, including one hosted by
IBM, enterprises may wish to host their own
internal registries behind their firewall
to better manage their internal implementation
of Web Services.</p>

<p>The IBM WebSphere UDDI Registry is a directory
for Web Services that is implemented using
the UDDI specifications. In contrast with
the IBM UBR this is a product offering for
companies or industries to implement.</p>
<p>A critical component of IBM's dynamic e-business
infrastructure, IBM WebSphere UDDI Registry
solves the problem of discovery of technical
components for an enterprise and its partners
by:<UL>
  <LI>Providing control, flexibility and confidentiality
  so that an enterprise can protect its e-business
  investments
  <LI>Increasing efficiency by making it easier
  to identify technical assets
  <LI>Leveraging existing infrastructures
</UL>
<P>
For example, the IBM WebSphere UDDI Registry
could be used in the following way within
a large enterprise:
<br>
<br>
A company has a legacy application that provides
phone numbers and HR information of employees.
This is turned into a Web Service and published
to the registry. A developer in the same
company needs to write an application for
a procurement function that also needs to
provide HR information to the supplier. The
application should allow the supplier to
have access to the employee account codes
once the employee provides his name or serial
number. Before Web Services, the developer
had three choices:<OL>
  <LI>Would not have known about the similar application
  <LI>Knew about it but could not reuse due to
  technical barriers
  <LI>Knew about it and reused only after significant
  time and negotiation
</OL>
<P>With UDDI, the developer can search for the
&quot;web service&quot; and reuse the existing
technical component in his new application
for the supplier in a matter of minutes.
The developer saves time and gets the application
up and running sooner than he would have
otherwise -- increasing efficiency and saving
the company time and money.
The IBM WebSphere UDDI Registry is the first
version 2 standard-compliant UDDI registry
for private enterprise work. The IBM WebSphere
UDDI Registry:
<UL>
  <LI>Supports the public UDDI V2.0 standard
  <LI>Leverages the proven, reliable WebSphere
  Application Server technology
  <LI>Uses a relational database, such as DB2,
  for its persistent store.
</UL>
