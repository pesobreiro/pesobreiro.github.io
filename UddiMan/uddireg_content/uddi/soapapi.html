<P>Access to the SOAP API will by default be
available at <BR><A href="http://localhost:9080/uddisoap/inquiryapi" target="_new">http://localhost:9080/uddisoap/inquiryapi</A> or <BR>
<A href="https://localhost:9443/uddisoap/publishapi" target="_new">https://localhost:9443/uddisoap/publishapi</A><BR>
Where 'localhost' is the address by which
your WebSphere server is known. If security
is enabled on your WebSphere server, the
publishapi will also be protected by basic-authentication.
By default, when security is enabled, the
publishapi is restricted to HTTPS, this is
to ensure the confidentiality and security
of your data whilst in transit to UDDI. If
you do not wish to use SSL, when security
is enabled, you will have to modify the jar
file using AAT to remove the CONFIDENTIAL
restriction placed upon the publish URLs.
For more information about this topic, see
the section on <A name="runatt" href="configure.html#runatt">Configuring SOAP properties with the AAT</A>
If you normally access your WebSphere server
via a web server, you will need to ensure
the plugin configuration for the WebSphere
plugin on the web server has been updated
since installing UDDI. This will then allow
access to the UDDI SOAP API through the URLs
<BR>
<A href="http://localhost/uddisoap/inquiryapi" target="_new">http://localhost/uddisoap/inquiryapi </A> or <BR> <A href="https://localhost/uddisoap/publishapi" target="_new">https://localhost/uddisoap/publishapi</A><BR>
Where 'localhost' is the address by which
your web server is accessed. Note that if
you plan on accessing UDDI via a web server
in this manner, that the samples will require
modification to inform them of the SSL certificates
used by your web server, so that the samples
can make SSL connections to the web server.
It is beyond the scope of this document to
cover the many variants available on web
server/WebSphere/java SSL configurations.<BR>

<H3><A name='usesoap'>Using the SOAP API</A></H3>
<P>To use the SOAP API construct a properly
formed UDDI message within the body of a
SOAP request, and send it using HTTP POST
to the URL of the API which the request relates
to. The response will be returned within
the body of the HTTP reply. Although the
samples are written in Java, you may use
other programming languages to create your
SOAP client, providing you still send requests
compliant to the SOAP specification. Valid
UDDI requests should conform to the UDDI
schema, and be as detailed within the UDDI
standard documentation available from <BR>
<A href="http://www.uddi.org/" target="_new">http://www.uddi.org/</A> </P>
<P>For more information on using the SOAP API,
refer to <A href="api.html#api">&quot;The application programming interface&quot;</A> section within this InfoCenter.</P>
<H3><A name="handlesoap">Handling Errors as a User of the SOAP API</A></H3>
<P>When using the SOAP API there are three main
categories that may cause an error to be
returned:- </P>
<UL>
  <LI>An invalid/incorrect request being sent to
  the SOAP API. eg. Incorrectly formed XML,
  Badly formed UDDI requests, Non-schema compliant
  requests.
  <LI>Invalid business logic within a SOAP API
  request. eg. Attempting to delete a business
  that does not exist.
  <LI>Problems occurring while processing a valid
  request. eg. Server connection to database
  failure.
</UL>
<P>In each of these cases, an error will be
returned to the client that made the request,
which will attempt to explain further what
the problem was. In the first case, where
the problem lies with the XML of the request,
the following section may be of assistance.</P>
<H3><A name='undersoap'>Understanding SOAP parsing errors.</A></H3>
<P>If an error occurs parsing SOAP input, UDDI
error code E_fatalError (10500) will be returned.
Following this, where applicable, will be
a message. Provided below are further explanations
on some of these Messages. This is not a
complete list of possible error explanations,
but is intended to give a flavor of the errors,
and their meanings.</P>
<P>Message: Element type 'fred' must be declared.<BR>
Explanation: Element 'fred' was found within
the supplied XML, yet is not recognized as
a valid element from the UDDI schema. Check
that you have not made a typing error within
your XML.<BR>
<BR>
Message: Attribute 'fred' must be declared
for element type &amp;quot;barney&amp;quot;.<BR>
Explanation: Attribute 'fred' was found declared
on element &amp;quot;barney&amp;quot;, yet
according to UDDI schema is not a valid attribute
for element 'barney'. Check that you have
not made a typing error within your XML.<BR>
<BR>
Message: The content of element type 'fred'
must match '(##any:uri=urn:uddi-org:api_v2)'.<BR>
Explanation: The content of element 'fred'
was found to be an element from the UDDI
schema, which is not supposed to be a child
element of 'fred'. Ensure the child elements
of 'fred' are compliant to the UDDI schema.<BR>
<BR>
Message: Element fred not allowed as a child
in barney<BR>
Explanation: The content of element 'barney'
was found to be 'fred' from the UDDI schema,
yet 'fred' is not supposed to be a child
element of 'barney'. Ensure the child elements
of 'barney' are compliant to the UDDI schema.<BR>
<BR>
Message: Attribute 'fred' is required and
must be specified for element type 'barney'.<BR>
Explanation: Attribute 'fred' was not present
on element 'barney', yet according to UDDI
schema 'fred' is a required attribute for
element 'barney'. Check that you have not
made a typing error within your XML.<BR>
