<P>The IBM WebSphere Private UDDI Registry contains
two sets of samples of varying complexity.<BR></P>
<OL>
  <LI>A simple sample to show the interaction with
  the UDDI registry using hand-crafted XML.
  This sample shows XML being sent to the server
  and being returned. It shows XML in flight
  to accomplish the following API functions:
  <UL>
    <LI>get_authToken - to gain access to the registry
    <LI>save_tModel - to register a tModel with the
    registry
    <LI>find_tModel - to search for a tModel within
    the registry
    <LI>delete_tModel - to delete a tModel from the
    registry
    <LI>discard_authToken - to 'remove' access from
    the registry
  </UL>
  <LI>A similar sample to the one above but using
  UDDI4J instead of XML. This will show the
  user the advantages of using UDDI4J to code
  their entries within the registry.
