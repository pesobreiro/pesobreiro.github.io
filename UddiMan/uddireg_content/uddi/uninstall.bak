<p>This topic describes how to remove the UDDI
Registry application (uddi.ear) from WebSphere
and how to uninstall the IBM WebSphere UDDI
Registry:<OL>
  <li>To remove the UDDI Registry application from
  WebSphere, complete the following steps:
  <OL>
    <LI>Start the WebSphere Administrative Console
    (the WebSphere Admin Server will need to
    be running for you to do this; you can start
    it from a command line with the command <TT>net start &quot;IBM WS Admin Server 4.0&quot;</TT>).
    <LI>Expand the tree view in the left-hand pane
    to display 'Enterprise Applications', and
    further expand that to display 'UDDI Registry'.
    <LI>Right click on 'UDDI Registry' and select
    Stop to stop the application. Click 'OK'
    when this completes.
    <LI>Right click again on 'UDDI Registry' and
    select Remove to remove the application.
    Say 'no' when asked whether you want to export
    the binding information, and then 'yes' when
    asked if you want to remove the UDDI Registry
    and the objects it contains. Click 'OK' when
    the remove completes.
    <LI>If you are removing the UDDI Registry application
    from WebSphere Application Server single-server
    edition for Developers (AEd), please refer
    to the section on &quot;Uninstalling applications
    with the Web Console&quot; in the InfoCenter
    for AEd. Please note that for AEd, you must
    also delete the directory corresponding to
    the application from the installedApps directory
    of the WebSphere AppServer.
  </OL>
  </li>
  <li>To uninstall the IBM WebSphere UDDI Registry
  files, you must first remove the UDDI Registry
  application from WebSphere, and then use
  the <B>Add/Remove Programs</B> function of the Windows Control Panel.
  <P>If the uninstall procedure is unable to remove
  all of the directories for the IBM WebSphere
  UDDI Registry, you should delete the target
  directory under which you installed the UDDI
  Registry (by default this is <TT>C:/WebSphere/UDDIReg</TT>) and all its subdirectories. If the install
  directory has for some reason been deleted
  without using Add/Remove Programs to uninstall
  the IBM WebSphere UDDI Registry, then you
  may need to manually delete its key from
  the Windows registry.<BR>
  </P>
  </li>
