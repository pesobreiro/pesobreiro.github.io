<H3><A href="index.htm#TOC4" name="verify">Installation Verification Program (IVP)</A></H3>
<p>This topic describes how to run the installation
verification programs (IVPs) to verify that
the IBM UDDI Registry has been installed
correctly. It assumes the samples are installed
on the same system as the Registry code.</p>
<p>
<b>Prerequisites:</b>

<UL>
  <li>Before starting the IVPs, you must have installed
  the IBM UDDI Registry as described in
<a href="install.html#install">Installing the IBM UDDI Registry</A>.
  </li>
</UL>
<p>
There are two IVP SOAP samples called SOAPSampleIVPa
and SOAPSampleIVPb. They are intended to
verify the successful installation of the
product, and should be used in conjunction
with the UDDI Users Console (GUI).
SOAPSampleIVPa saves some data to the registry
which you can then find using the GUI. Finally
you can delete the data by running SOAPSampleIVPb.
</p>
<p>
The IVP samples are installed into the same
target directory as the other SOAP samples
and they use the same XML files as the basic
Java SOAP samples.
</p>
<p>
SOAPSampleIVPa saves three businesses, six
services (2 per business) and three tModels.
The data structures are very basic and consist
only of a name. The keys returned by the
save_* UDDI API calls are then written to
a file, <tt>SOAPSampleIVPa.out</tt>.

SOAPSampleIVPb then reads in these keys
from the file in order to delete the saved
data from the UDDI registry.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b>
Each time you run SOAPSampleIVPa, it
overwrites the output file 
<tt>SOAPSampleIVPa.out</tt> so, if you wish to use SOAPSampleIVPb to
delete the data, you must run this before
you next run SOAPSampleIVPa.
</p>

<p>
To run the IVPs, complete the following steps
on the same system as the UDDI Registry:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Ensure that DB2 and the WebSphere Admin Server
  are started.</li>
  <LI>Start the WebSphere Administrator's Console
  and ensure the default server is started
  and the UDDI Registry Application is started.</li>
  <LI>For SOAP samples to work, you need to ensure
  that the Client JDK is either the one shipped
  with IBM WebSphere Application Server or
  a later IBM JDK.:
  <UL>
    <LI>For Windows - ensure that C:\WebSphere\AppServer\java\bin
    is present in the PATH statement before and
    other JDK's
    <LI>For Linux - ensure that /opt/WebSphere/AppServer/java/bin
    is present in the PATH statement before and
    other JDK's
  </UL>
  <P><B>NOTE:</B> You <B>must</B> use the IBM WebSphere supplied JDK or a
  later level of the IBM JDK.</P>
  <P>For Windows, the default system path can
  be set via <B>Control Panel ...-&gt; Settings ...-&gt;
  System ...-&gt; Advanced Properties ...-&gt;
  Environment Variables</B><BR>
  Alternatively, this can be accomplished
  just
  for the shell where you plan to run the
  samples
  by modifying the path within the shell:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>For Windows - set path=c:\WebSphere\AppServer\java\bin;%path%
    <LI>For Linux - export PATH=/opt/WebSphere\AppServer/java/bin:$PATH
  </UL>
  <LI>Copy the samples from &lt;UDDI-install-dir&gt;\samples\soap
  and *.xml to a directory, and compile and
  run them there (see next bullets)</li>
  <LI>Compile both SOAPSampleIVPa and SOAPSampleIVPb
  by typing 'javac SOAPSampleIVPa.java' and
  'javac SOAPSampleIVPb'.</li>
  <LI>Run SOAPSampleIVPa by typing 'java SOAPSampleIVPa'.
  This should publish a number of businesses
  and services and service types into the registry.</li>
  <LI>Start your Web browser on the same system
  as the UDDI Registry.</li>
  <li>To display the UDDI GUI home page, type one of the following URLs:
  <ul>
  <li>If you have WebSphere security disabled: <tt>http://localhost:9080/uddigui</tt> 
   </li>
  <li>
  If you have WebSphere security enabled:
  <tt>https://localhost:9433/uddigui</tt>
  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>
On the find page, complete the following steps:
<ol>
<li>Select the business radio button</li>
<li>In the data entry field, type <tt>%</tt> (percent is the wild card symbol)</li>
<li>Click <b>Find</b></li>
</ol>
<p>You should get a results page returned with
  three businesses (mybusiness1, mybusiness2,
  and mybusiness3). This demonstrates that
  the API and the UDDI Console are working
  correctly.</p></li>
  <LI>To see the services that are available
  for a business, click the &quot;Show Services&quot;
  option next to the business.
  </li>
  <LI>To delete all of the IVP data, run SOAPSampleIVPb
  (from the command prompt as before - by typing
  'java SOAPSampleIVPb')</li>
  <LI>
On the find page, complete the following steps:
<ol>
<li>Select the business radio button</li>
<li>In the data entry field, type <tt>%</tt> (percent is the wild card symbol)</li>
<li>Click <b>Find</b></li>
</ol>
<p>You should get an empty results page returned.
</li>
</OL>
