<P>If you are migrating to version 1.1.1 of
the IBM WebSphere UDDI Registry having previously
installed version 1.1, then you should read
the section on <a href="migrate.html#migrate">&quot;Migrating from an earlier
release of the IBM WebSphere UDDI Registry&quot;</a>
prior to installing the product.</P>
<p><a name="prereqs"><b>Prerequisites:</b></a> 

<ul>
<li>Ensure that you system has one of the following operating systems:
<UL>
  <LI>Windows NT Server 4.0 SP 6a or higher</li>
  <LI>Windows 2000 Advanced Server 2000 SP1 or
    SP2 or Windows Server 2000 SP1 or SP2</li>
    <LI>Red Hat Linux 7.1, 2.4 kernel 
    <LI>SuSE Linux for Intel 7.1. 2.4 kernel 
  </UL>
  </li>
  <li>Ensure that you have
the following products already installed
on your system:
<UL>
    <LI>DB2 Enterprise Edition Version 7.2 FP5 or FP6.
    <LI>A web server, such as IBM HTTP Server 1.3.19,
    Microsoft Internet Information Server 5.0,
    or any other web server supported by WebSphere
    Application Server (see <A href="http://www-4.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/doc/v40/prereqs/ae_v403.htm" target="_new">http://www-4.ibm.com/software/webservers/appserv/doc/v40/prereqs/ae_v403.htm</A>).
  </li>
  <LI>WebSphere Application Server Advanced Edition
    (AE) v4.0.3 or WebSphere Application Server
    Advanced Edition - Developer Only Option
    (AEd) v4.0.3.</li>
    <LI>A browser: Internet Explorer V5.5 with SP2
    and security fix Q321232 (which must be applied
    in that order), or Netscape Navigator V6.1
    or later.</li>
  </UL>
  </li>
  <LI>Installation of WebSphere Application Server
  defaults the JDBC Drivers to 1.0 level.
  You
  <B>must</B> upgrade this driver to 2.0 level by running
  the <I>usejdbc2</I>command file. On Windows systems, <I>usejdbc2.bat </I>is located in &lt;DB2-install-dir&gt;\java12
  (unless you have installed DB2 into a different
  directory location than the default location).
  On Linux, this is located in $HOME/sqllib/java12
  as usejdbc12, where $HOME is the home directory
  of the DB2 instance. On Windows the 'DB2
  JDBC Applet Server' must be stopped (for
  example, via the 'Services' menu) when you
  run the <I>usejdbc2.bat</I>, otherwise you will get a 'file locked error'.
  Failure to run <I>usejdbc2.bat</I> will cause the WebSphere Application Server
  to fail on startup with an error code of
  10. It is particularly important to run <I>usejdbc2.bat</I> on Windows systems.
  <li>If you do not have security turned on in
your WebSphere Application Server, then you
are recommended to install
the IBM WebSphere UDDI Registry before
enabling WebSphere security. If you have
security turned on, then the UDDI Registry
installation program prompts you
for your WebSphere userid and password several
times.
  </li>
  <LI>Ensure DB2 is started.
  <UL>
    <LI>On Windows operating systems, it will be
    started automatically, unless you have changed
    the installed defaults. You can check whether
    DB2 is started, and start it manually, from
    the Windows 'Services' application (accessed
    via the Control Panel for Windows NT and
    via the 'Administrative Tools' option in
    the Control Panel for Windows 2000). The
    service name is DB2-DB2.
    <LI>On Linux operating systems, you should switch
    to the DB2 instance you intend to use
    for
    the UDDI Registry, using <I>su - db2inst1</I> where db2inst1 is the instance id, then
    ensure that sqllib\db2profile has been executed,
    either by having been called from the id's
    profile, or by executing '<I>. ./sqllib/db2profile</I>'. You can then run <I>db2start </I>to start DB2.
  </UL>
  <li>Ensure that you have a DB2 userid
(and password) with administrative
privileges, needed to 
create and access the UDDI Registry
database.
  </li>
  <li>
As part of the installation process, the
  module visibility of your application server
  is changed to 'Application' which
  is required by the UDDI Registry application.
</li>
  <LI>If you have previously installed the IBM
  WebSphere UDDI Registry, ensure that you
  have uninstalled the product from your system
  (on Windows, this is done via Add/Remove
  Programs; on Linux via <CODE>rpm -e IBMWebSphere-UDDI</CODE>).
<li>If you plan to use UDDI4J to access the IBM UDDI Registry, you must use the
version 2 API supplied with the product. UDDI4J version 1 is not supported.
</li>
</ul>
<H3><A name="windows">Installation on Windows platforms</A></H3>
<p>To install the IBM WebSphere UDDI Registry
on Windows, complete the following steps:<OL>
  <li>Download 'IBMWebSphereUDDI_1.1.1_nt.zip'
  from the download site and unzip this file
  into a temporary directory. In this temporary
  directory you will find, amongst others,
  the following files:
  <ul>
    <li>A<B> </B><B>readme.txt</B><B> </B>file, which should always be read first.
    In general it duplicates these instructions
    but may include last minute corrections.</li>
    <li>A <B>setup.exe</B> file to start the installation.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <LI>Run the <B>setup.exe</B> file.
  <P>Please note that the WebSphere Application
  Server will be recycled during this install,
  so you should stop any other WebSphere work
  before running setup.exe, and close the WebSphere
  Administrative Console.</P>
  <P>The setup program checks whether you already
  have an instance of the IBM WebSphere UDDI
  Registry installed on your system. If you
  do, then it will give you the option to overwrite
  the existing installation, or to abort the
  install process. Unless you are re-installing
  the same service level of the product, you
  should abort the install process and remove
  the existing installation using Add/Remove
  Programs from the Control Panel, before running
  <B>setup.exe</B> again.</P>
  <P>The setup program checks that you have
  the prerequisite level of database product
  installed (see <A href="#prereqs">Prerequisites</A> above).
  <ul>
    <li>If you have the required level of one of
    the prerequisite database products installed,
    the installation uses this product for the
    UDDI registry. If you have more than one
    of the prerequisite database products installed,
    then you will be asked which you would like
    to use for the UDDI Registry database.</li>
    <li>If you do not have a prerequisite level of
    database product installed, the installation
    will offer you the choice of continuing the
    installation (by answering 'Yes') or aborting
    the installation (by answering 'No'). You
    should only answer 'Yes' if you are planning
    to do a custom install of just the Information
    Center, the UDDI4J package, the Samples,
    or the EJB client files.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The installation also checks for the version
  of WebSphere Application Server installed
  on the system. If the appropriate level
  (See <A href="#prereqs">Prerequisites</A> above) is not installed, then the installation
  will offer you the choice of continuing the
  installation (by answering 'Yes') or aborting
  the installation (by answering 'No'). You
  should only reply 'Yes' if you are planning
  to do a custom install of just the Information
  Center, the UDDI4J package, the Samples,
  or the EJB client files.</p>
  <p>The installation of the IBM WebSphere UDDI
  Registry continues automatically, and you
  are prompted whenever you need to make a
  decision that affects the installation, as
  follows.<LI>You are asked to state that you agree
  the licence terms and conditions. These
are the licence terms and conditions that
  you accepted when you obtained the product;
  for example, from the download site.
  </li>
  <li>You are given the option to override the
  default directory location (Destination Folder),
  in case you want to. To override the default
  directory location, select 'Browse' and then
  either browse to find a suitable directory
  location or type an alternative location,
  and click <B>OK</B>. If the directory does not exist, you are
  asked if you want to create it. Click <B>Next</B> to continue. In the rest of these instructions,
  the directory location is referred to as
  &lt;UDDI-install-dir&gt;.</li>
  <li>You are prompted to select either a Custom
  or a Typical
  install:
  <ul>
    <li>Typical install is the default. This installs
    all the components of the IBM WebSphere UDDI
    Registry that you need to use it.</li>
    <li>The Custom install allows you
  to select one or more of the following
    components:
    <UL compact>
      <LI>UDDI Registry Files</li>
      <LI>UDDI4J</li>
      <LI>InfoCenter</li>
      <LI>Sample Files</li>
      <LI>Setup UDDI Registry Database
      <LI>EJB</li>
    </UL>
    <p><b>Notes:</b>
    <ul>
      <LI>If you select <B>UDDI</B> <B>Registry File</B><B>s</B>, which installs the IBM WebSphere UDDI registry
      program, then you should also select at least
      the '<B>Setup UDDI Registry Database</B>' component as well.
      <li>You can choose not to setup the UDDI Registry
      database (by not selecting <b>Setup UDDI Registry Database</b>); for example, if you are installing on
      top of a previous version of the IBM UDDI
      Registry Database, and want to preserve existing
      data in the registry. However, be aware that
      the format of the registry data might have
      changed, so that your old registry database
      might no longer be compatible.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The main purpose of the Custom Install option
    is to allow you to install other components,
    such as the Information Center, or the
    Samples,
    or the UDDI4J package, on a separate
    machine
    from the UDDI registry files. The components
    that can be selected on a Custom Install
    are:</p>
    <UL>
      <LI>UDDI Registry Files - this choice installs
      the IBM WebSphere UDDI Registry program.
      If this is your first installation then you
      must select Setup UDDI Registry Database.
      The InfoCenter is automatically selected.
      <LI>UDDI4J - this choice installs the UDDI4J
      package.
      <LI>InfoCenter - the choice installs the Information
      Center.
      <LI>Sample Files - this choice installs the installation
      verification programs and the other
      UDDI
      sample programs.
      <LI>Setup UDDI Registry DB - this choice will
      install the code that will load your UDDI
      database. It is essential you select this
      option if this is a new installation. If
      you choose NOT to setup the UDDI Registry
      database, please refer to the note above
      referring to 'You can choose not to setup
      the UDDI Registry database....&quot;.
      <LI>EJB - this choice will install the EJB client
      classes and javadocs for the EJB interface.
    </ul></li>
</ul></li>
    <LI>You are prompted to provide a database userid
  and password during the UDDI installation.
  This userid is used to create and access
  the UDDI Registry database, and should be
  a userid with administrative privileges which
  obeys the rules for DB2 userids.
  <p>Some database setup is performed for you
    as part of the installation process.
    Some
    of this setup needs the WebSphere Administrative
    Server to be running; if it is not, the
    installation
    process starts it for you.
    <p>The database setup completes the following
  steps:<OL>
      <LI>Create a JDBC provider in your WebSphere
    Application Server called 'UDDI JDBC Driver'
    and an associated data source (UDDI data
    source). If you already have a JDBC provider
    called 'UDDI JDBC Driver' then this, together
    with any associated data source, is replaced.</li>
      <LI>Create a database called UDDI20 and populate
    it with the tables and standard categorization
    schemes that are required for the UDDI
      Registry.
    If you already have a database called
      UDDI20,
    then this will be replaced (unless you
      choose
    not to 'Setup UDDI Registry Files', as
      part
    of a Custom install).</li>
    </OL>
    <LI>The installation process will places a file
  <I>uddi.ear</I> into the &lt;UDDI-install-dir&gt;, copy
  it into the<I> installableApps</I> subdirectory of the WebSphere application
  server installation, and deploy it into WebSphere.
    <LI>When the installation has finished, you will
  see a screen asking you if you want to
  look
  at the readme. If you wish to view the
  readme
  then check the box otherwise click on '<B>Finish</B>' to complete the installation.
    <li>If you are installing the IBM WebSphere UDDI
    Registry onto WebSphere Application Server
    single-server edition for developers (AEd),
    you should now continue to the section &quot;Installing
    on WebSphere Application Server single-server
    edition for Developers (AEd)&quot;.</li>
    <LI>After completing the installation you will
  be able to see the UDDI Registry application
  using the WebSphere Administrative Console
  as follows:
  <OL>
      <LI>Start the WebSphere Administrator's Console
    if it is not already running.
      <li>In the navigation pane, expand the administrative
    domain so that you can see '<b>Enterprise Applications'</b>, and expand that to show the applications
    that are installed. An application called
    'UDDI Registry' should be shown.

<P>The UDDI Registry is supplied as a J2EE application
file, uddi.ear. This is automatically installed
into the WebSphere Application Server during
installation. If you want to change any of
its configuration properties using AAT see
<A href="configure.html#runatt">
&quot;Configuring SOAP properties with the
AAT&quot;</A>. You will need to remove uddi.ear from WebSphere
