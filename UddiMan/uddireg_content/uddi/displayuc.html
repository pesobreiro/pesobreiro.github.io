This topic describes how to display the UDDI Registry user console (sometimes referred to as the GUI).
The URL you use depends on whether or not you have enabled WebSphere security:

<UL>
  <LI>If you have the WebSphere security disabled,
you can access the UDDI User Console by
using the following URL in your Web browser:
  <pre>http://localhost:9080/uddigui</pre>
  <p><b>Note:</b> With WebSphere security disabled,
all the publish operations are performed
using a userid of UNAUTHENTICATED.
  </li>
  <li>If you have WebSphere security enabled,
you can access the UDDI User Console through
  HTTPS by
using the following URL in your Web browser:
  <pre>https://localhost:9443/uddigui</pre>
  <p>The User Console displays the default frameset
  containing the header frame, navigation frame
  showing find options, and details frame.
  When you click the link to show the publish
  options in the navigation frame, you are
  challenged for a userid and password.</p>
  <p>If WebSphere security is enabled and you
  try to access a publish action via an unsecured
  link, e.g. clicking the publish link on the
  navigation frame where the User Console was
  opened with <CODE>http://localhost:9080/uddigui</CODE>, you will get a security constraint error
  (HTTP Error 403). Inquire functions will
  work as expected.</P>
