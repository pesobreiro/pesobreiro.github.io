<P>
In the UDDI User Console, there are a number
of places where you can specify category
values (this is in the &quot;locators&quot;
section on several of the forms).
To find a value corresponding to the possible categories
in the various categorization schemes, you
should do the following:</P>
<OL>
  <LI>Start the DB2 Control Center (by <B>Start -&gt;Programs-&gt;IBM DB2-&gt;Control
  Center</B>)
  <LI>Expand the tree on the left-hand pane to
  get to the Systems-&gt;<I>machine name</I>-&gt;instances-&gt;DB2-&gt;Databases-&gt;UDDI20
  <LI>Expand UDDI20 and select &quot;Tables&quot;
  <LI>You will see a list of tables, one of which
  is called CATEGORY
  <LI>Right click on this and either select &quot;Export&quot;
  to export the data to an output file, or
  select &quot;Sample Contents&quot;
  <LI>If you view the data using &quot;Sample Contents&quot;,
  then you will need to click on &quot;Next&quot;
  to view further rows, or use the filter
  to
  select the items of interest
  <LI>The data consists of rows of four fields
  per row: NAME, CODE, DESCRIPTION and PARENTCODE
  <LI>The NAME is the name of the categorization
  scheme, which can be udditype, naics, unspcs,
  geo or unspsc7. These provide categorizations
  by geography, type of business, etc.
  <LI>The CODE is the value you should specify
  on the UDDI User Console, corresponding
  to
  the DESCRIPTION which describes the category
  you want to search for (on Find requests)
  or specify (on Publish requests)
  <LI>Having found the category value (CODE) you
  want to use, you should then enter it into
  the form and select the categorization scheme
  (NAME) to which it belongs from the pull-down
  menu
</OL>
