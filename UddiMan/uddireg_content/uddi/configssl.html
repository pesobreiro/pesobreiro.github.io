<P>To support the use of secure access with
the IBM WebSphere UDDI Registry, you need
to configure WebSphere to use HTTPS and SSL.
This section describes a simple way in which
you can do this for WebSphere Application
Server AE, using the WebSphere sample certificates.
<B>Please note that this configuration should
never be used in a production environment.</B> A more comprehensive way of setting up SSL
is to configure SSL through the web server,
as described in section <cite>6.6.18.1a.7 Configuring SSL in WebSphere Application
Server</cite> in the WebSphere Application Server Advanced
Edition InfoCenter.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> The following instructions are for WebSphere
Application Server AE; if you are using AEd
then refer to the AEd documentation.</P>
<p>
To configure WebSphere to use HTTPS and SSL,
complete the following steps:
<OL>
  <LI>Set aliases of your Virtual Host:
  <OL>
    <LI>On the WAS AE Administrative Console, in
    the tree on the left-hand side click
    on <B>Virtual Hosts...-&gt; Default Host</B> (or whichever host you have set up the UDDI
    Registry to use if you are not using the
    default one.)
    <LI>On the &quot;General&quot; tab, add a new
    host alias, called &quot;*:9443&quot;. (9443
    is the default WAS SSL port.) This is in
    addition to the aliases &quot;*:9080&quot;
    and &quot;*:80&quot; which should already
    be setup. (Make sure that there are colons
    and not full stops between the * and the
    number.)
    <LI>Click &quot;Apply&quot;.
  </OL>
  <LI>Add a new HTTP transport
  <OL>
    <LI>In the tree, go to <B>Nodes... -&gt; machine name... -&gt; Application
    Servers... -&gt; Default Server</B> (or whichever server you have set up to
    use if not the default one.)
    <LI>Go to the &quot;Service&quot; tab, select
    &quot;Web Container Service&quot;, and press
    &quot;Edit properties&quot;.
    <LI>Go to the &quot;Transport&quot; tab. There
    should be at least one transport already
    defined, with host=* and port=9080.
    <LI>Press &quot;Add&quot; to add a new transport.
    On the &quot;General&quot; tab, enter
    &quot;*&quot;
    as the host and &quot;9443&quot; as the
    port.
    Check the &quot;Enable SSL&quot; and
    &quot;Use
    Global SSL Default Configuration&quot;
    checkboxes.
    Press &quot;OK&quot;.
    <LI>Press &quot;OK&quot; again.
    <LI>Press &quot;Apply&quot;.
  </OL>
  <LI>Check Default SSL Configuration - needed
  for Samples
  <P>The SSL configuration uses key files and
  trust files. If you haven't changed these
  then the initial default values are adequate
  and will work with the samples. However,
  if you have changed the trust and key values,
  then you will either need to edit the SOAP
  sample code, or check that your SSL configuration
  is set up appropriately as follows:</P>
  <OL>
    <LI>Go to the <B>Console... -&gt; Security Center</B> menu.
    <LI>Go to the &quot;General tab and click the
    ellipsis &quot;...&quot; button next to &quot;Default
    SSL Configuration&quot;.
    <LI>Go to the &quot;General&quot; tab. The settings
    should be:
    <UL>
      <LI>Key file name = ${WAS_HOME}/etc/DummyServerKeyFile.jks
      (the password for this file is &quot;WebAS&quot;)
      <LI>Key file format = JKS
      <LI>Trust file name = ${WAS_HOME}/etc/DummyServerTrustFile.jks
      (the password for this file is &quot;WebAS&quot;)
      <LI>Trust file format = JKS
      <P>You don't need to enable client authentication
      and the security level can be left as &quot;high&quot;.</P>
    </UL>
  </OL>
  <LI><P>For SOAP samples to work, you need to ensure
  that the Client JDK is either the one shipped
  with IBM WebSphere Application Server or
  a later IBM JDK.:</P>
  <UL>
    <LI>For Windows - ensure that C:\WebSphere\AppServer\java\bin
    is present in the PATH statement before and
    other JDK's
    <LI>For Linux - ensure that /opt/WebSphere/AppServer/java/bin
    is present in the PATH statement before and
    other JDK's
  </UL>
  <P><B>NOTE:</B> You <B>must</B> use the IBM WebSphere supplied JDK or a
  later level of the IBM JDK.</P>
  <P>For Windows, the default system path can
  be set via <B>Control Panel ...-&gt; Settings ...-&gt;
  System ...-&gt; Advanced Properties ...-&gt;
  Environment Variables</B><BR>
  Alternatively, this can be accomplished just
  for the shell where you plan to run the samples
  by modifying the path within the shell:</P>
