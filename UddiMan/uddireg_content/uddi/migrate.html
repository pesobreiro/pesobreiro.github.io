UDDI Registry</a></H2>
<H3>Behavioural changes</H3>
<OL>
  <LI>There have been a few minor changes to the
  EJB interface which mean that you may need
  to rewrite your EJB client applications:
  <OL type="a">
    <LI>Remove any declarations that involve any
    of the classes in the <B>com.ibm.uddi.exceptions</B> package. There are only 5 Exceptions:
    <UL>
      <LI>DuplicateLanguageCodeException
      <LI>EmptyNameException
      <LI>PersistenceException
      <LI>TooManyConnectionsException
      <LI>TooManyNamesException
    </UL>
    <P>This includes trying to do a <B>throw/catch</B> or <B>throws</B> for any of these Exceptions, and also trying
    to <B>import</B> the package, or trying to instantiate/subclass
    any of the Exceptions.</P>
    
    <LI>In the BusinessEntity class, a user cannot
    set the name of the business by doing
    an
    <B>exampleBusinessEntity.setName(String aString);</B>
    <P>The user must now do an <B>exampleBusinessEntity.setNames(com.ibm.uddi.datatypes.NameList
    aList); </B>(please note that it is setName<B>s</B> and not setName as before)</P>
  </OL>
  <LI>Some changes have occured with the behaviour
  of the UDDI User Console with regard to SSL
  and authentication:
  <OL type="a">
    <LI>With authentication disabled, it is now possible
    to inquire and publish via HTTP on port 9080,
    or HTTPS on port 9443 (if configured).
    <LI>With authentication enabled, it is possible
    to inquire over HTTP without authenticating.
    Publish actions require access via HTTPS
    on port 9443 and you will be asked for authentication.
  </OL>
  <LI>tModels are now called technical models
</OL>
<H3>Migration procedure</H3>
<P>If you have previously installed version
1.1 of the IBM WebSphere UDDI Registry, then
you should take the following steps in order
to migrate to version 1.1.1.</P>
<P>UDDI Version 1.1.1 requires a new level of
WebSphere Application Server, Version 4.0.3.
It is recommended that you upgrade in two
steps:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Upgrade to WebSphere Application Server 4.0.3
  and then confirm that UDDI will still run
  as expected.
  <LI>Upgrade to UDDI Version 1.1.1
</UL>
<OL>
  <LI>Upgrade to WebSphere Application Server 4.0.3.
  <LI>If you have made any changes to the configuration
  properties in the file uddi.properties, which
  is located in the properties subdirectory
  of your WebSphere AppServer install tree,
  then you should make a copy of this file
  (or make a note of all the changes), so that
  you will be able to reapply the changes to
  the file after you have installed the new
  release. The uddi.properties file will be
  replaced by the installation procedure.
  <LI>Uninstall the IBM WebSphere UDDI Registry
  using Add/Remove Programs on Windows platforms,
  or rpm -e IBMWebSphere-UDDI on Linux. This
  will remove the application, but will preserve
  the UDDI Registry database.
  <LI>Please note that you will be prompted during
  the installation procedure as to whether
  you want to replace the UDDI Registry database.
  If you have any data in the UDDI Registry
  which you wish to preserve, then you should
  reply &quot;<B>No</B>&quot; when prompted &quot;Do you want to
  create a new UDDI Registry database?&quot;
  and then confirm this choice.
  <LI>You can now follow the instructions on &quot;<A href="install.html#windows">Installation on Windows Platforms</A>&quot; or &quot;<A href="install.html#linux">Installation on Linux Platforms</A><A href="install.html#windows#install">&quot;</A>.
  <LI>After completing the install procedure, you
  should edit the uddi.properties file to reflect
  any changes that you require to the configuration
  properties. You should <B><U>not</U></B> replace this file with your previous copy
  from version 1.1 of the IBM WebSphere UDDI
  Registry as its format has changed.
