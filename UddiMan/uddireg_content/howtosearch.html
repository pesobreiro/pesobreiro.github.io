</ul>

<p>A correctly working search should display an input box, although you might 
need to be patient (waiting approximately 30 seconds or less) if you are starting 
the search for the first time during a work session.</p>

<p>After clicking "Search" on the top of the InfoCenter frame set, if you do not 
then see the input box displayed on the left side of the InfoCenter, use the above 
links to view "Enabling the search."</p>

<!--Using the search-->
<h3><a name="use" href="howtosearch.html#top">Using the search</a></h3>
<!-- former content of howtosearch -->
<p>Search documents accessible from the InfoCenter for a 
single or multiple words.  The search is not case sensitive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<!--Single word search-->
<h4>Single word search</h4>

<p>Type the word in the input field and click the Search button.</p>

<!--Multiple word search-->
<h4>Multiple word search</h4>

<p>Type each word, separated by a blank space, and click the Search button.  
For example:
<pre>
<em>word1 word2 word3</em>
</pre>
<p>The search will be on the words in the order they appear. For example,
a search on "red orange" will find the phrase "red orange" but not the
phrase "orange red."</p> 

<!--Using search results-->
<h4>Using the search results</h4>
<p>The search yields a list of the documents that contain the search word 
or words. To display a document, click the entry in the list.</p>

<!--Search rankings-->
<h4>Search rankings</h4>

<p>The documents are listed in order from the highest ranking hit (indicated by 
  *****) to the lowest ranking hit (*). A document may contain more than one hit, 
  each with a different ranking. The document is assigned the ranking of its highest 
  ranking hit. The number of hits is indicated by a number following the ranking, 
  for example (***4). If two documents have the same ranking, then the document 
  with the most number of hits will be higher in the list.</p>

<p>If you searched for multiple words, any document that contains all of the search words in the specified order 
will be listed as a high ranking hit. If only one or two of the words are found, 
or if there are intervening words, or if the words are in a different order, 
the hit will be lower ranking.</p>

<!--Search restrictions-->
<h4>Search restrictions</h4>
<p>Boolean searches are not supported.  The common boolean search qualifiers <tt>and</tt> and <tt>or</tt> are in the list of common words that are ignored in a search.  Thus, both of the following searches will produce the same results:</p>
<pre>
servlets and beans
servlets or beans
</pre>

<p>Wildcard searches are not supported.  The search on 
<tt>java*</tt> will only look for the literal string <tt>java*</tt>. It
will not find <tt>javadoc</tt>, for example.</p>

</blockquote>

<!--Enabling search-->
<h3><a name="gen" href="howtosearch.html#top">Enabling the search</a></h3>

<p>Although the InfoCenter is not implemented in JavaHelp, it does use the standard 
JavaHelp search, encapsulated in an applet for use from a 
Web browser. Some users will not have to perform any enablement tasks to begin using this 
lightweight, effective search.</p>
 
<p>The most common search problems seem to be related to the Java and applet support 
provided by various browser brands and versions. After enabling a browser to support the 
search applet, or finding another browser that does, runtime search problems are rare. The main task is 
ensuring that your browser will display the search applet in the first place.</p>

<p>To support the search, your browser must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support Java applets</li>
<li>Have its Java support turned on (see your browser documentation for instructions)</li>
</ul>

<p>Though the IBM WebSphere InfoCenter team does not endorse the use of any particular
browser brand or version for performing the search, as long as the browser supports the 
above technologies, be aware that:</p>
 
 <br>
 <ul>
 <li>Testing is performed using Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer, but
 does not include every available version of these browsers on every
 supported operating system.</li>
 <li>Most problem reports involve Netscape browsers, with the majority of cases being a 
 common but fairly simple to fix problem described below.</li>
 </ul>
    
<!--IE enablement and workarounds-->
<h3><a name="ie" href="howtosearch.html#top">Microsoft Internet Explorer enablement and workarounds</a></h3>

<p>At this time, there are no known problems that are specific to Internet Explorer.</p>

<!--Netscape enablement and workarounds-->
<h3><a name="ns" href="howtosearch.html#top">Netscape Navigator or Communicator enablement and workarounds</a></h3>
 
<p>If your Netscape browser fails to display the search input box, try the following workarounds. You might need to
 extrapolate the workarounds to your particular version and environment. For the most part, 
 particular error messages are 
 not discussed because it has been found that any one of several messages can indicate 
 the same basic problem. Do not disregard a workaround just because the error message
 mentioned in the description does not match the one that you are encountering.</p>

<!--Shut the browser down and start again-->
<h4>Shut the browser down and start again</h4>

<p>Although it sounds simplistic, this workaround can help:</p>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Stop all instances of Netscape browsers so that there is no Netscape code of any sort 
running on the machine.</li>
<li>Open an instance of the Netscape browser once again.</li>
<li>Try once again to start the search.</li>
</ol>

<p>Optionally, try removing all saved internet files by purging the browser cache. 
For example, this can be done on Netscape by selecting the following: <b>Edit</b> 
<img src="insarrow.gif" alt="then click" width="9" height="9"> <b>Preferences</b> 
<img src="insarrow.gif" alt="then click" width="9" height="9"> <b>Advanced</b> 
<img src="insarrow.gif" alt="then click" width="9" height="9"> <b>Cache</b> <img src="insarrow.gif" alt="then click" width="9" height="9"> 
<b>Clear Disk Cache</b> and <b>Clear Memory Cache</b>.</p>

<!--Help the browser find a JVM security class-->
<h4>Help the browser find a JVM security class</h4>

<p>A common problem involves a missing or misplaced security class. Try the following workaround, 
especially if you see the following line in the browser Java console:</p>

<pre>
   <code>Cannot find class	 java/security/InvalidParameterException.</code>
</pre>

<p>To fix the problem, you must ensure that the browser can find the classes in 
the java.security package. Netscape browsers can access classes provided through the system 
CLASSPATH environment variable. For information about accessing and changing your system CLASSPATH, 
refer to your operating system documentation or system administrator.    </p>

<p>Use one of the following solutions to provide the <samp>InvalidParameterException.class</samp>
to the Netscape browser.</p>
<p><strong>If you have a JDK installed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>You can download the latest JDK from <a href="http://java.sun.com"
target="_blank">http://java.sun.com</a>
<p>For older JDKs that have a classes.zip in the lib directory, 
make sure that the CLASSPATH environment variable 
points to <samp>classes.zip</samp> of your JDK.</p>

<p>For example, in AIX, add the following to your .profile file.<br>
<samp>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLASSPATH=/usr/jdk_base/lib/classes.zip<br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;export CLASSPATH<br>
</samp></p>
</li>


<li>For newer JDKs that do not include <samp>classes.zip</samp> file, add the 
	<samp>rt.jar</samp> (the runtime environment jar) file to the system CLASSPATH.
	Sun's JDK and JRE downloads include the <samp>rt.jar</samp> file.  WebSphere Application 
	Server and WebSphere Studio also provide JDKs and the <samp>rt.jar</samp> file.
	<ol>
		<li>To locate the <samp>rt.jar</samp> file on your system, from a command window, enter:

		<samp> dir &lt;<var>jdk_root</var>&gt; /s rt.jar</samp> (on Windows platforms) or <br>
		<samp>ls &lt;<var>jdk_root</var>&gt;/rt.jar</samp> (on UNIX platforms)<br>
		</li>
		
		<li>After you locate the <samp>rt.jar</samp> file, do the following:
			<ol type="square">
				<li>Add the <samp>rt.jar</samp> file to the system CLASSPATH, as for example:
				<pre>&lt;<i>jdk_root</i>&gt;\jre\lib\rt.jar</pre>
				</li>

				<li>Add the <samp>\bin</samp> directory for the JDK to the system path, as for example:
				<pre>&lt;<i>jdk_root</i>&gt;\bin</pre>
				</li>

				<li>Apply the changes.  To ensure the changes are activated, reboot your system.</li>

				<li>Open your Netscape browser and start the Java console.</li>

				<li>Run the search applet.  You might still see some error messages, such as the following, 
					but the search should return results.<br> <br> 
				<code>
				# Error: Invalid Hash of this JAR entry (-7882)<br>
				#	jar file: C:\TEMP\jzip8D6H.TMP<br>
				#	path:     com/sun/java/help/search/GeneratorHeap.class<br>
				# Error: This operation cannot be performed because a required<br>
					certificate has expired.  Click on the `Security' icon<br>
					for more information about certificates. (-8181)<br>
			   #	jar file: C:\TEMP\jzip8D6H.TMP<br>
			   #	path:     C:\TEMP\jzip8D6H.TMP<br>
			   # Error: loading of signatures has failed (-1)<br>
			   #	jar file: C:\TEMP\jzip8D6H.TMP<br>
			   #	path:     /F|/test_search/wps/doc/de/InfoCenter/<br>
			   </code>
               <p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;The path to the JDK varies by system, and the JDK must be compatible with the browser
				version. Consult the browser documentation for specific  restrictions.</p>
			   </li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	   </ol></ul>
<p><strong>If you do not have a JDK installed</strong></p>
<ul><li>
<p>If the machine that runs your Netscape browser does not have a JDK installed, then Netscape 
cannot use the CLASSPATH environment variable to find the InvalidParameterException.class file. 
Instead, you can provide your own dummy version of InvalidParameterException.class for the 
Netscape browser to use.</p>
<ol>
<li>On a machine with the JDK installed, compile the following source file named 
	InvalidParameterException.java: 
<pre>
package java.security;

public class InvalidParameterException
 extends Exception
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
     System.out.println("dummy class " +
     "allowing Netscape " +
     "to work with the Search applet.");
  }
}

</pre>
	</li>

	<li>Copy the resulting InvalidParameterException.class file to your client machine 
	and to a location where the Netscape browser can find it. 
<p>Depending on the browser version, place the file in a location relative to 
the "java" directory under your Netscape browser installation:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>For Netscape Navigator version 4.08 or later, put the class file in the following 
		directory: <br>
		<var>Netscape installation directory</var>/java/security/ 
		<ol>
			<li>Create a &quot;security&quot; directory under &quot;java&quot;.</li>
			<li>Put InvalidParameterException.class in the security directory.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>For Netscape Navigator 4.07 and earlier, put the class file in the following 
	directory: <br>
	<var>Netscape installation directory</var>/java/classes/java/security/ 
	<ol>
	  <li>Create a &quot;java&quot; directory under &quot;classes&quot;.</li>
	  <li>Create a &quot;security&quot; directory under &quot;java&quot;.</li>
	  <li>Put InvalidParameterException.class in the security directory.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	</ul>
<p>Create new directories as needed. For example, for the older browser workaround, 
create two new directories, java and security under classes. If necessary, try all 
locations, to see whether one will work for your particular 
browser.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</ul>

<!--Reporting search problems-->
<h3><a name="report" href="howtosearch.html#top">Reporting search problems</a></h3>

<p>If you find a problem that is not already documented here, you can notify either your
IBM support representative (if running a locally installed search) or the
IBM Web site team (if using the search contained in the online WebSphere
InfoCenter).</p>

<p>Please include the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether you are using a locally installed search or the IBM Web site version</li>
<li>The browser brand (Netscape, Internet Explorer) and version</li>
<li>Any information or errors reported by the browser, through its Java console or otherwise</li>
<li>Description of the problem</li>
</ul>

<p>Although many search problems seem to be browser related (which means they are often 
outside of the control of this IBM product), it is acknowledged that they can frustrate
users of our product. Alternatives are being explored to improve the quality of the search for 
all users, regardless of browser peculiarities.</p>
