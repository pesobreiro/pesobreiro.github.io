<!-- How do I Bookmark -->
<h3><a name="bookmark" href="using.html#top">How do I bookmark?</a></h3>
<p>Bookmarking a Web page that uses frames is a quick two-step process:</P>
<ol>
<li>Right-click anywhere in the frame that you want to bookmark. 
<li>Select <strong>Add Bookmark</strong> if you are using Netscape Navigator.<br>
Select <strong>Add to Favorites</strong> if you are using Microsoft<sup><sup>(R)</sup></sup> 
Internet Explorer. 
<p>Note: When appropriate you may want to rename the bookmarked page to reflect 
the content; otherwise, you may replace any previous InfoCenter bookmarks. Some 
browsers automatically assign a unique name based upon the page name.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When you use your new bookmark, your browser opens the specific page that you 
selected when you created the bookmark without opening the other frames that were 
displayed originally.</p>
<!-- What browsers are supported -->
<h3><a name="supported" href="using.html#top">What browsers are supported?</a></h3>
<p>The InfoCenter supports browsers Netscape Navigator 6.1 and Microsoft Internet 
Explorer 5.5 and higher. In addition, JavaScript must be enabled in the browser. 
If you use a different or earlier version of a browser, your pages may format 
differently and some functions may not work correctly. Also, the InfoCenter uses 
Java applets to create the Search and the Table of Contents. Not all browsers 
support these applets. Therefore, there is an alternate HTML-based Table of Contents 
that you may select to use if you have trouble with the Java-based Table of Contents.</p>
<!-- How do I navigate the InfoCenter -->
<h3><a name="navigate" href="using.html#top">How do I navigate the InfoCenter?</a></h3>
<p>The InfoCenter uses frames to help you navigate through the content. The <strong>navigation 
frame</strong>, on the left, may display the table of contents or the search. 
The <strong>content frame</strong>, on the right, shows you the information. This 
is the frame you will most likely want to bookmark or print. The <strong>banner 
frame</strong>, on the top, is the InfoCenter masthead. You can use it to select 
different ways of navigating the InfoCenter. Finally, the <strong>header frame</strong>, 
on the top, contains options for showing the Java or HTML version of the table 
of contents, and external links to resources on the internet.</p>
<p>The navigation frame at the left is available in both a Java<sup>TM</sup> version 
and an HTML version. Click the appropriate icon in the header frame above the 
navigation frame to select the one you prefer. In the Java table of contents, 
click the topic to view the subtopics. Click it again to hide the subtopics.</p>
<p><b>Hint:</b> To expand or collapse all subtopics, press the control key while 
clicking on the parent topic.</p>
<!-- What are java and non java gifs in the footer for -->
<h3><a name="navgifs" href="using.html#top">What are <b>the links in the </b> 
banner for?</a></h3>
<p><b>Contents</b> loads an applet-based table of contents that allows you to 
show and hide sections of the table of contents. If the applet does not load, 
use the <b>HTML</b> link to access an HTML version of the table of contents. Each 
time you click on <b>Contents</b> the applet reloads, collapsing all items in 
the table of contents.</p>
<p><b>Search </b>launches the search feature, if available. When you click <b>Search</b> 
a new window will display giving an input field and Search button. The search 
function utilizes a Java applet and may not work on all browsers. For more information 
on the search, refer to <cite>Using the WebSphere InfoCenter search</cite>, that 
opens in the right frame, when search is launched.</p>
<p><b>HTML</b> loads an HTML table of contents. The HTML version allows you to 
view the table of contents if the navigation applet does not load.</p>
<p><b>PDF</b> loads a PDF library, which consists of all the information available 
in PDF. PDF files are best used for printing and searching the information.</p>
<!-- What if the navigation does not work -->
<h3><a name="navbarwork" href="using.html#top">What if the navigation does not 
work?</a></h3>
<p>The default table of contents uses a Java applet, which allows you to expand 
and collapse topics. If the navigation frame is blank, you may be using a browser 
that does not support Java, does not have Java enabled, or your Java Virtual Machine 
(for Internet Explorer, the Microsoft Virtual Machine) may not be the latest version. 
Click the HTML icon in the banner to use the HTML version of the table of contents.</p>
<!-- How do I print information -->
<h3><a name="print" href="using.html#top">How do I print information from the 
InfoCenter?</a></h3>
<p>Because you may want to read and work with hardcopy information, the InfoCenter 
includes PDF files of topics that can be viewed and printed.</p>
<ol>
<li>First, select a specific PDF file, which opens it in a new browser window.</li>
<li>Then to print, follow one of these steps: 
<ul>
<li>Click the article you want to print, and click your browser <strong>Print</strong> 
button.</li>
<li>Click the article you want to print, and select <strong>Print</strong> from 
the <strong>File</strong> menu. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This allows you to print the individual article without including the information 
in the navigation frame.</p>
<!-- How do I search -->
<h3><a name="search" href="using.html#top">How do I search the InfoCenter?</a></h3>
<p>The InfoCenter shipped with this product includes a search function 
accessed by clicking on the Search keyword above the navigation pane.  
<!-- What is the Web library -->
</p>
<h3><a name="weblibrary" href="using.html#top">What is the Web Library (in the 
footer)?</a></h3>
<p>If you are connected to the internet, clicking on Web Library in the footer 
will launch a new browser window and open the WebSphere Library page, which contains 
links to the Library pages for individual WebSphere products. The Library pages 
typically contain the latest version of documentation such as release notes, readme 
files, specification sheets, installation guides, and instruction manuals. There 
may also be links to related white papers and IBM Redbooks.</p>
<!-- What is the Web site -->
<h3><a name="website" href="using.html#top">What is the Web Site (in the footer)?</a></h3>
<p>If you are connected to the internet, clicking on Web Site in the footer will 
launch a new browser window and open the main Web site for IBM WebSphere products. 
The Web site contains links to the latest news and information about all WebSphere 
products, including support, downloads, documentation, services, and events.</p>
<!-- How do I adjust the font size -->
<h3><a name="fontsize" href="using.html#top">How do I adjust the browser's font 
size?</a></h3>
<p>A cascading style sheet (CSS) governs the appearance of the InfoCenter. However, 
the text size remains flexible. The text is displayed in the size indicated in 
the user's Web browser settings.</p>
<p>The instructions for changing the font size vary between browser brands and 
versions. Consult the browser product documentation for instructions.</p>
