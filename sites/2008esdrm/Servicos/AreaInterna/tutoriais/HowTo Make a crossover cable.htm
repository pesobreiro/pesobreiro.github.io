        Typically the ports on a hub are MDIX ports. This allows the machine at 
        the other end to utilize its MDI Port (which is what typically a NIC card 
        uses) without the need for a crossover cable. When I say that the ports 
        on the hub are MDIX ports, what I mean is that one of the functions of 
        the hub is to automatically perform the crossover functions, which are 
        required to properly align the cables with each other. When no hub or 
        switch is used, your cable itself must physically perform these crossover 
        functions. <br>
        <br>
        To expand on this a little, when using a hub or switch, the <u>Transmit</u> 
        wires on the workstation need to be connected to the <u>Receive</u> wires 
        on the hub; likewise, the <u>Receive</u> wires on the hub need to be connected 
        to the <u>Transmit</u> wires on the workstation. But if you remember what 
        we stated earlier - cables which are run from PC to Hub are 'straight 
        through' type cables. This is because the hub is providing the required 
        crossover functions internally for you. Thus, when you connect two machines 
        together without the use of a hub or switch, a crossover cable is required 
        - because both 'ends' are essentially the same - a NIC Card. The crossover 
        function must take place somewhere, and since there is no hub or switch 
        to do it for you, the cable must. <br>
        <br>
        Now that we know what a crossover cable is for, let's talk for a few about 
        types of cabling. The two most common unshielded twisted-pair (UTP) network 
        standards are the 10 Mbit (10BASE-T Ethernet) and the 100Mbit (100BASE-TX 
        Fast Ethernet). In order for a cable to properly support 100 Mbit transfers, 
        it must be rated <u>Category 5</u> (or CAT 5). This type of low loss extended 
        frequency cable will support 10 Base T, 100 Base-T and the newer 100VG-AnyLAN 
        applications. Other types of cabling include Category 3 which supports 
        data rates up to 16 Mbps, and Category 1 which only supports speeds up 
        to 1Mbps. The cable we are about to make is considered Category 5, and 
        will work on both 10 Mbit and 100 Mbit systems, assuming all components 
        used (cables and jacks) are rated for Category 5. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <font color="#ff9900"><b><u>What you need</u></b> </font><br>
        <b>Cable</b> - Be sure the cable(s) you are using is properly rated for 
        CAT 5. It should state clearly on the jacket of the cable, what it is 
        rated at. One option that you have when selecting your cable is to use 
        a pre-made normal 'straight through' cable, and simply whack off one of 
        the ends, and replace with a new &quot;Crossed Over&quot; end. For the 
        purpose of this article, though, we aren't going to go that route. We 
        are going to make the whole thing from scratch - using bulk CAT 5 cable.

        <font size="2" face="tahoma, arial, verdana, helvetica"><br>
        <br>
        <b>Connectors</b> - Crossover cables are terminated with CAT 5 RJ-45 (RJ 
        stands for &quot;Registered Jack&quot;) modular plugs. RJ-45 plugs are 
        similar to those you'll see on the end of your telephone cable except 
        they have eight versus four contacts on the end of the plug. Also, make 
        sure the ends you select are rated for CAT 5 wiring. There are also different 
        types of jacks which are used for different types of cabling (such as 
        Solid Core wire). Make sure you buy the correct jacks for your cabling. 
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Crimper</b> - You will need a modular crimping tool. My advice on what 
        brand to get? Well, I really don't have a preference at this point, but 
        make sure you buy a good one. If you spend about 40 to 50 bucks, you should 
        have one that will last ya a lifetime. Spend 10 to 20 bucks, and you might 
        be able to make a few cables with it if you're lucky. You definitely get 
        what you pay for when it comes to crimpers! <br>
        <br>
        <b>Stripper</b> - No I'm not talking about what <a class="fresh" href="http://www.littlewhitedog.com/reviews_other_00002.asp">Spot 
        had at his bachelor party</a>, I am talking about a tool to strip the 
        ends off the wires you pervert! There are several specialized tools, which 
        can be used to strip the jackets off of cabling. If you do not have access 
        to one of these tools, cautious use of a razor blade or knife should work 
        just fine - but keep in mind if you go the razor blade / knife route, 
        extra special care must be used as to not damage the wires inside the 
        jacket. <br>
        <br>
        <b>Cutters</b> - You need a pair of cutters that will allow you to cut 
        a group of cables in a straight line. It is very important that all the 
        wires are the same lengths, and without proper cutters, this can be a 
        difficult task. <br>
        <br>
        <br>

        <font color="#ff9900"><b><u>Doing the deed</u></b> </font><br>
        You now know what crossover cables are used for. You know why you need 
        one. You also know what you need to make one, so I guess we're ready... 
        First thing you will want to do it cut off the appropriate length of cable 
        that you will need. Be sure that it is plenty long enough. If you screw 
        up, and don't cut it long enough, you will have to start all over, and 
        you will not only waste you time, but cable and the RJ-45 ends as well. 
        If you are pulling this cable through a wall, or ceiling, make sure the 
        pulling is completed first. It is much more difficult to pull a cable 
        with the ends already on it. So you have all the parts, you understand 
        the concepts, and you have your cable, lets get started!</font> <blockquote> 
        <p align="center"><b><u><font face="tahoma, arial, verdana, helvetica" size="3">Baby steps... 
              </font></u></b> 
              <font face="tahoma, arial, verdana, helvetica" size="2"><br><br><b>1)</b> - Start by stripping off 
              about 2 inches of the plastic jacket off the end of the cable. Be 
              very careful at this point, as to not nick or cut into the wires, 
              which are inside. Doing so could alter the characteristics of your 
              cable, or even worse render is useless. Check the wires, <b>one 
              more time</b> for nicks or cuts. If there are any, just whack the 
              whole end off, and start over. <br><br>

              <br><br></center><b>2)</b> - Spread the wires apart, 
              but be sure to hold onto the base of the jacket with your other 
              hand. You do not want the wires to become untwisted down inside 
              the jacket. Category 5 cable must only have 1/2 of an inch of 
              'untwisted' wire at the end; otherwise it will be 'out of spec'. 
              At this point, you obviously have ALOT more than 1/2 of an inch of 
              un-twisted wire, but don't worry - well take care of that soon 
              enough. <br><br>

              <center> 
              <br><br></center><b>3)</b> - Up to this point, things 
              have been pretty easy. Things will get a little bit tricky here, 
              but don't worry, we'll get through this together. We are at a 
              point in this article where a decision needs to be made. You need 
              to decide which end of the cable you are making at this point in 
              time. If you are making your cable from scratch like I am doing 
              while writing this article, you have 2 end jacks, which must be 
              installed on your cable. If you are using a pre-made cable, with 
              one of the ends whacked off, you only have one end to install - 
              the crossed over end. Below are two diagrams, which show how you 
              need to arrange the cables for each type of cable end. Decide at 
              this point which end you are making and examine the associated 
              picture below. <br><br>

              twisted exposed wires on your cable. Use caution so that you do 
              not untwist them down inside the jacket. Once you have all the 
              wires untwisted begin to arrange them in the proper order based on 
              the pictures above. This stage can be a pain in the ass, 
              especially some of the middle wires. Once you get all the wired 
              arranged in the proper order, make sure your wire cutters are 
              within reach then grasp them right at the point where they enter 
              the jacket. Make sure you keep them in the proper order! Grab your 
              cutters now. Line them up along your prepared wires about 1/2 inch 
              above the jacket. Be sure at this point that you are both 1/2 inch 
              above the jacket, and that your cutters are aligned straight 
              across the wires. You want to make a clean cut here - also make 
              sure you don't let go of that jacket / wires! <br><br>

              point forward things get a lot easier. Grab your jack, and begin 
              to slide the wires into the jack. Once you get to the point where 
              the jacket begins to enter the jack things might get a little 
              tough, but just have some patience and hold onto those wires. It 
              will fit in there just fine. Once it is in as far as it will go 
              the wires should extend almost to the front of the jack, and about 
              3/8 of an inch of the jacket will be inside the jack. Like the 
              pictures below. <br><br>

              because not all crimpers are exactly the same your pictures may 
              not match exactly what you see below. Be sure to keep a good grip 
              on that jack and the cable. Insert the jack into the crimper. It 
              should only go in one way, so you don't have a whole lot to worry 
              about inserting it. Begin to compress those crimpers. You will 
              more than likely hear a clicking sound. Keep squeezing. If you try 
              to let go to early, nothing will happen. They will not release. 
              Keep going until they stop clicking / stop moving all together. At 
              this point, you should be able to let go of the jack, and the 
              crimpers. The crimpers should release now leaving you with a 
              crimped jack. If the crimpers do not release, you probably are a 
              wimp and didn't press hard enough. Go ask your mom to help you at 
              this point. She can probably finish what you started. <br><br>

              <p align="center"><font face="tahoma, arial, verdana, helvetica" size="2"><br><br><b>6)</b> - It's time to examine what we have done. 
              If you look at the end of the jack (distal), you should see that 
              the copper connectors should not be pressed down into the wires. 
              Toward the back of the jack (where the jacket meets the jack) it 
              should be crimped securely holding the jacket / cable in the jack. 
              If something has gone wrong, don't worry, its not the end of the 
              world. Grab those cutters, and just whack the whole jack off and 
              start back at step 1 (a pain in the ass I know, but its better to 
              have a cable that works, than to spend hours trouble shooting your 
              PC trying to figure out why you can't see the other machine). If 
              everything is cool, all you have to do now is make the other end 
              of the cable (unless you are using a pre-fab cable and have

              other end now. <br><br>

              should now have a fully functional CAT 5 Crossover cable. It's a 
              good idea to label it as such, especially if you have a lot of 
              other cables lying around. So what are ya waiting for... install 
              the cable and test it out. If it doesn't work, double-check the 
              ends. There is always a possibility that you have overlooked 
              something. If so just whack the bad end and make new one. Remember 
              the more jacks you install, and the more cables you make, the 
              easier it gets. It's really not that hard to do, the first time is 
              definitely the most difficult. <br><br>Here are a few other things 
              to keep in mind...</font>
