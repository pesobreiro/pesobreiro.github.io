REQUIREMENTS
============

Connection to the Internet
--------------------------
You DO NOT need a connection to the Internet to read this book. You can read this book directly from the CD-ROM, copy it onto a local machine, or share it over an intranet.  

However, this book contains jumps that go to sites on the World Wide Web. These jumps begin with http: and are designated by a telephone icon. To use these jumps, you must have a connection to an Internet Service Provider (ISP) over either a network or a modem. 


Web Browser
-----------
To view this book, you need a Web browser that supports frames and style sheets, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0. 

You can get Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0 from the ValuPack folder on the Office 97 or Microsoft Access 97 CD-ROM, or on the network you installed Office or Microsoft Access from. To install Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0 from the ValuPack folder, you can double-click the shortcut that was added to your desktop when you installed Office 97 or Microsoft Access 97. 

Alternatively, if you have access to the World Wide Web, you can download Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0 from the Internet. In Microsoft Access, point to Microsoft on the Web (Help menu), and then click Free Stuff.


WHERE TO START
==============
To open the online version of Building Applications with Microsoft Access 97, double-click OpenBook.htm in the Access subfolder of the ValuPack folder.

CHOOSING A TABLE OF CONTENTS
============================
The chapters in this book are separated into sections; each section is one online page. Use the table of contents in the left frame to move through the online pages of this book in the right frame. There are two navigation systems available: the default table of contents and an Explorer-view table of contents.

Using the Default Table of Contents
-----------------------------------
To use the default table of contents to move through this book, click a chapter title or section heading in the left frame to display the page that contains that section in the right frame. If you click a chapter title, the right frame displays the first page of that chapter. To see all the chapters in the table of contents, scroll down the left frame by clicking its scroll bar.

Using the Explorer-View Table of Contents
-----------------------------------------
If you want to be able to see most of the table of contents at once in the left frame, you can install a control that displays the contents in an Explorer-type view. In this view, you can see the contents of a chapter by clicking the plus sign (+) to the left of the chapter title. Then you can double-click the heading of the section you want to read. If you double-click a chapter title, the first page of the chapter opens in the right frame. To collapse a chapter's table of contents, click the minus sign (-) to the left of the chapter title.

To use this view of the table of contents, click the ActiveX Tree Control icon on the opening page of the book.

Important: 
If you use this view, the control automatically installs 1.5 MB of files on your hard drive. The files that are installed are listed below.

[File list for Windows 95 users:]

Windows\System\TreeCtl.ocx
Windows\System\bahtml.itc
Windows\System\msvcrt.dll
Windows\System\mfc42.dll
Windows\Occache\treectl.inf 

And if you create a bookmark:
Windows\System\bahtml.itb

[File list for Windows NT version 4.0 users:]

WinNT\System32\TreeCtl.ocx
WinNT\System32\bahtml.itc
WinNT\System32\msvcrt.dll
WinNT\System32\mfc42.dll
WinNT\Occache\treectl.inf 

And if you create a bookmark:
WinNT\System32\bahtml.itb

If you want to remove the control from your machine, delete these files.

If you load the Explorer-view table of contents and the left frame is blank, please copy bahtml.itc from the \ValuPack\Access\BldApps folder on the Office CD into the same folder in which your system installed the treectl.ocx file. Then refresh the page. If you still have problems, please call Tech Support.

PRINTING SIDEBARS
=================
The titles within sidebars (text surrounded by a blue box) do not print.

JUMPING TO SUBHEADINGS
======================
If you use a jump that goes to a subheading on a page you have not yet visited, the jump will take you to the beginning of that page. To go to the subheading, scroll down the page.
