<H1>Where Does the Information Come From?</H1>

<P>
The key to tracking progress is accurate data about each task, resource, and cost. You need information such 
as each task’s completion percentage, remaining work, who did what and when, and task costs to date.
<P>
If the project is small, you can collect data on task progress yourself. This enables you to verify the accuracy 
of the data as you collect it. You’ll also have more control of when you get the information, because you don’t 
have to wait for others to send it to you.
<P>
For more complex projects, the individuals responsible for each task or area can report progress to you, 
relieving you of a time-consuming task. Also, those closest to the work know best the status of the tasks 
they’re working on. In a large project, you’ll probably have no choice but to get information from others.
<P>
On the other hand, each person has his or her own reporting style, adding an element of subjectivity — one 
person’s 50 percent complete is another person’s 40 percent complete. You’ll need to spot-check incoming 
information for accuracy. In addition, some people might not report status information to you when you want 
it, so there might be delays in receiving and incorporating up-to-date information.
<P>
The easier you can keep your methods of data collection, the more likely you are to get the information you 
need in a timely manner. Keep your team’s status-reporting method as simple as the needs of the project allow.
<P>

Others.&quot;</A>
