<P>
<B>Table</B>
<P>
A set of columns that shows specific information about tasks or resources in a sheet&nbsp;view.
<P>
<B>Task</B>
<P>
A cohesive, individual unit of work that is&nbsp;part of the total work needed to accomplish a&nbsp;project.
<P>
<B>Task dependency</B>
<P>
The nature of the dependencies between linked tasks. You link tasks by defining a&nbsp;dependency 
between their finish and start dates. There are four kinds of task dependencies in Microsoft Project: finish-to-
start (FS), in which a&nbsp;task cannot start until another task finishes; start-to-start (SS), in which a task 
cannot start until another task starts; finish-to-finish (FF), in&nbsp;which a task cannot finish until another 
task finishes; and start-to-finish (SF), in which a task cannot finish until another task starts.
<P>
<B>Task duration</B>
<P>
See <I>duration.</I>
<P>
<B>Task list</B>
<P>
A list of all the tasks required to achieve a project’s goals. A task list can include tasks, phases, and 
milestones.
<P>
<B>Task type</B>
<P>
A method used by Microsoft Project to&nbsp;calculate task work, duration, and resource units. See 
<I>fixed&#151;duration task</I>, <I>fixed&#151;units task</I>, <I>fixed&#151;work task</I>.
<P>
<B>Task view</B>
<P>
A view that displays task information.
<P>
<B>TeamInbox</B>
<P>
The place where workgroup members receive workgroup messages sent via the web and&nbsp;manage their 
task lists. Workgroup members access the TeamInbox using a web browser and use it to receive new task 
assignments, track the progress of their tasks, receive update requests from the workgroup manager, and send 
status messages back to the workgroup manager regarding the progress of their tasks. When using&nbsp;the 
TeamInbox, workgroup members can send messages to the workgroup manager, but they cannot send 
messages to other workgroup members.
<P>
<B>Template</B>
<P>
A Microsoft Project file format that lets&nbsp;you reuse existing schedules as the starting point for creating 
new schedules. Task and resource information, direct formatting, macros, and project-specific settings can all 
become part of a template.
<P>
<B>Timescale</B>
<P>
The time period indicator that appears at the top of Gantt Chart views and the Resource Graph, Task Usage, 
and Resource Usage views. The timescale consists of a major timescale and a&nbsp;minor timescale. Both the 
major and minor timescales can display units of minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, quarters, years, thirds of 
months, and half years. For example, the major timescale can display units of months while the minor timescale 
displays units of weeks.
<P>
<B>Total cost</B>
<P>
The calculated cost of a project, task, or resource over the life of the project.
<P>
<B>Total slack</B>
<P>
The amount of time a task can slip without affecting the project’s finish date. When the total slack is negative, 
the duration for a task&nbsp;is too long for its successor to begin on the date required by its constraint. See 
<I>free slack</I>, <I>slack&nbsp;time</I>.
