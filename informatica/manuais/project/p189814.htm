<H2>Reschedule Uncompleted Work to Start on the Current Date</H2>

<P>
If you want to make sure there’s no work scheduled for dates that have already passed, you can reschedule 
uncompleted work to start on the current date for selected tasks or for the entire project. This can be 
advantageous if your project has fallen behind schedule and you want your project to accurately reflect how 
much work still needs to be done to complete the project.
<P>
Rescheduling the remaining work may remove task constraints. For example, if a task has a Must Finish On 
constraint, and rescheduling the remaining work for the task would move the finish date beyond the constraint 
date, Microsoft Project will reset the constraint to As Soon As Possible. You should reschedule the remaining work manually if you have 
other task constraints you want to preserve.
<P>
For tasks that are partially complete, Microsoft Project automatically splits the task between the completed 
work and the remaining work. Rescheduling the remaining work for a partially completed task may create a gap 
between the two portions of the task, which will appear on the Gantt Chart as a split task.
