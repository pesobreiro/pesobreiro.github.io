<P>
It’s true that you can enhance your project file by writing notes and creating graphics within Microsoft Project. 
However, from time to time you may want to bring in other kinds of information for your project team to read as 
they choose. For example, you could give people the opportunity to read about a particular part of the project 
in depth, provide tips that are helpful but not essential, or provide other material that is pertinent but best 
created in another program or shared by several files. Such information is only a click away when you add 
hyperlinks to your project file.
<P>
When you click the hyperlink text or graphic, you go from your project file to another file. The destination can 
be practically any file, such as another Microsoft Project file, a Microsoft Word document, a Microsoft Excel 
workbook, a Microsoft Access database, a Microsoft PowerPoint® presentation, or any web site on an intranet 
or the World Wide Web. When you click a hyperlink, the destination file opens on your screen.

One common way to use a hyperlink is to include information from a web site. For example, you can create a 
hyperlink right in a project task that goes to a web document recounting the complete history of that task: 
problems encountered, changes in resource assignments, reasons for delays, and so on. Anyone who opens 
the project file can jump to that task information.
