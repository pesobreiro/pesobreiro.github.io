<H2>Workgroup Message Viewing in the E-mail Inbox, WebInbox, or TeamInbox</H2>

<P>
The e-mail inbox, WebInbox, and TeamInbox coordinate workgroup messages between the workgroup manager 
and workgroup members. If you use an    e-mail–based messaging system, the workgroup manager sends 
workgroup messages from Microsoft Project. Workgroup members receive these messages in their e-mail 
inboxes and send their replies to the workgroup manager’s e-mail inbox.
<P>
In a web-based messaging system, the workgroup manager uses the WebInbox to receive workgroup 
messages, and workgroup members use the TeamInbox to send and receive messages. The general process is 
as follows:
<UL>
<LI>The workgroup manager assigns tasks to workgroup members using TeamAssign messages in Microsoft 
Project.
<LI>Using a web browser, a workgroup member logs on to the TeamInbox, receives his or her TeamAssign 
messages, and accepts or declines the task assignments. A workgroup member can view only the tasks that are 
assigned to him or her.
<BR>If the workgroup manager has assigned tasks for multiple projects to a workgroup member, the 
TeamInbox organizes the tasks according to each project’s file name.
<LI>The workgroup manager uses a password to log on to the WebInbox in Microsoft Project to receive 
workgroup members’ responses. From these responses, the workgroup manager can update the project 
schedule.
</UL>
<P>
Because web-based communications systems can’t signal incoming messages, workgroup members need to 
check their TeamInboxes regularly for new messages. If you’re using both an e-mail–based and a web-based 
system, however, Microsoft Project can send notification messages to a member’s e-mail inbox whenever the 
TeamInbox receives workgroup messages.
