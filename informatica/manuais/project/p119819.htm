<H2>Change the Constraint Type</H2>

<P>
Using constraints, you can control the start or finish date of important tasks. Microsoft Project automatically 
assigns the As Soon As Possible constraint when you enter a task. You should set other constraints only 
when necessary, such as when a client or contract requires that a task begin or end by a specific date.
<P>
Task constraints can help you create a more accurate schedule using detailed information. But constraints can 
also limit your schedule’s flexibility. If there’s a scheduling conflict between a constraint and a task 
dependency, Microsoft Project may schedule the task according to the constraint.
<P>
At various stages in your project, you may want to check the constraints on tasks in your schedule, 
particularly the tasks on the critical path, to make sure they remain necessary. Any constraint that requires you 
to enter a date should be applied carefully. Microsoft Project may recalculate the start and finish dates of a task 
with a flexible constraint, such as the Start No Earlier Than constraint. But fixed-date constraints, such as the 
Must Start On constraint, prevent Microsoft Project from recalculating the start and finish dates if the schedule 
changes. Fixed-date constraints also limit your ability to level overallocated resources.
<P>
For more information about why you should use constraints cautiously, see <A HREF="p6981.htm">Chapter 
6, &quot;Tying Tasks to Specific Dates.&quot;</A>

<P>If a task must start or finish in relation to a specific date, you can change its constraint from the default 
(As Soon As Possible) or change it back to As Soon As Possible.
