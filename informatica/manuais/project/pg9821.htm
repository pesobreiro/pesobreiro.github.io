<P>
<B>Web browser</B>
<P>
A computer program capable of locating and displaying information accessible on the World Wide Web. 
Workgroups based on an intranet or the World Wide Web need a browser to communicate.
<P>
<B>Web server</B>
<P>
A server program designed to process requests from other computers that want to display a web site. A web 
server can also serve as the repository for web sites. The web server must be installed on a computer that has 
the appropriate hardware and connections for accommodating the web requests that it receives.
<P>
<B>Web site</B>
<P>
Any document or object on an intranet or the World Wide Web that is formatted in HTML and is accessible 
from a web browser.
<P>
<B>Webmaster</B>
<P>
The person who administers an organization’s web server.
<P>
<B>Work</B>
<P>
The labor required (in terms of minutes, hours, days, or weeks) for one resource unit (namely a person) to 
complete a task. Work should not be confused with a task’s duration or&nbsp;a&nbsp;resource’s duration on 
a task. For example, a&nbsp;resource may require 32&nbsp;hours of work to complete a task, but the task may 
be scheduled with a duration of 2&nbsp;days. This indicates that more than one resource needs to be put on 
this task, namely two. Working 8&nbsp;hours a day on the task, two people would complete the task in 
2&nbsp;days.
<P>
<B>Workgroup</B>
<P>
A group of people working on the same project who use a common system of communication for exchanging 
project information.
<P>
<B>Workgroup manager</B>
<P>
The individual in the workgroup who is creating and maintaining the project schedule in Microsoft Project and 
who is using&nbsp;workgroup messages to assign tasks to the workgroup members. The workgroup manager 
also uses the workgroup features to update tasks in the project file as workgroup members send their replies.
<P>
<B>Workgroup members</B>
<P>
Those individuals in a workgroup who receive workgroup messages from the workgroup manager. Workgroup 
members can receive and reply to their messages by either using a 32-bit, MAPI-compliant 
e-mail system or by using their web browser to log on to&nbsp;the TeamInbox.
<P>
<B>Workgroup messages</B>
<P>
Messages that the workgroup manager sends using Microsoft Project to workgroup members regarding the 
tasks of a project. There are three kinds of workgroup messages, all of which the workgroup members are able 
to reply to:
<UL><LI>TeamAssign, which is used to assign tasks to workgroup members.
<LI>TeamUpdate, which is used to inform workgroup members of changes to tasks in the schedule.
<LI>TeamStatus, which is used to request that workgroup members provide the workgroup manager with the 
current status of the tasks in question.</UL>
<P>
<B>Working time</B>
<P>
Hours designated in a resource or project calendar during which work can occur.
<P>
<B>Working times calendar</B>
<P>
A calendar that stores all&nbsp;expected working and nonworking days and hours. This type of calendar is 
used by Microsoft Project to schedule tasks. There are two types of&nbsp;working times calendars: base 
calendars and resource calendars. See <I>base calendar</I>, <I>resource calendar</I>.
<P>
<B>Workspace</B>
<P>
A set of files and settings that you&nbsp;can save and reopen by opening a single workspace file. Workspace 
files have the .mpw extension. When you create a workspace file, Microsoft Project creates lists of the current 
settings, open projects, views, and so on. When you open a workspace file, Microsoft Project 
uses&nbsp;these lists to recreate the workspace so you&nbsp;can resume work where you left off.
<P>
<B>World Wide Web</B>
<P>
A system for exploring web sites that reside on the Internet. The World Wide Web is the most visible and 
popular component of&nbsp;the Internet.
