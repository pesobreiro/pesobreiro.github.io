<H2>Teambuilding Benefits</H2>

<P>
Norm Seff explains that one of the greatest benefits provided by Microsoft Project is that it has helped to build 
a sense of &quot;team&quot; between his company and subcontractors. With only four full-time employees 
simultaneously managing a number of projects, his company depends heavily on the reliability of its 
subcontractors.
<P>
Adkim has reversed the traditional scheduling paradigm in which employees submit time sheets at the end of a 
week regardless of whether certain milestones have been reached.
<P>
Microsoft Project allows the company to present each individual with a customized schedule detailing what is 
expected of them in advance. Subcontractors and employees are invited to discuss their schedules with 
management and work together to make any changes.
<P>
Adkim’s teambuilding process resulted in greatly improved accountability of subcontractors adhering to their 
scheduling commitments. Advance participation in the decision-making process motivated them to buy into 
the process, reinforcing a sense of teamwork. Seff explains that subcontractors are thrilled to work with a 
contractor who can give them more than 24-hour advance notice of any changes.
<P>
Seff uses filters to send updated individual Microsoft Project schedules to all relevant subcontractors and 
suppliers through a fax modem. The complete control that Microsoft Project provides sends a message to 
architects and interior designers that Adkim is a professional and efficient company to work with.
<P>
The improved accountability and reliability of scheduling also enhances the company’s reputation with 
customers. Microsoft Project allows Norm to give customers definite answers instead of guesses when they 
ask him how long their jobs will take from start to finish.
