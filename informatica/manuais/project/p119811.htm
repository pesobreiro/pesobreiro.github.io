<H2>Assign More Resources</H2>

<P>
If extra or underused resources are available, you can keep cost increases to a minimum while reducing task 
duration. By assigning additional resources who have available hours during their normal working days, you 
can pay them at their standard rates, which is less costly than paying overtime to already assigned resources.
<P>
You may already have part-time resources on your team, or you may be able to shift some resources from 
noncritical tasks to critical tasks. You could also hire new resources. If additional units of the same resource are 
available, you can increase the number of resource units assigned to a task. For example, if the three painters 
assigned to paint a wall can’t finish the job soon enough and a fourth painter is available, you can assign the 
fourth painter to the task. For information about resource units, see <A HREF="p8981.htm">Chapter 8, 
&quot;Assigning Resources to Tasks.&quot;</A>
