<P>
Sergio estimates that by using Microsoft Project he spends between 25% and 50% less time editing and 
updating changes to the master schedule. This time savings enabled him to accomplish much more than when 
using the paper tracking system.
<P>
Once baseline scheduling was established, editing and reporting with Microsoft Project became much easier 
and more productive. Microsoft Project automated the lengthy process needed to create project status reports, 
saving many hours in preparation time.
<P>
The strategic planning system based on Microsoft Project has proved to be vastly superior to the paper 
system for retrieving and reporting important data. Sergio notes that the new system is being expanded to 
include schedules from other Litton divisions.
