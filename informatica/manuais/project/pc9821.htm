<P>
A wide variety of third-party hardware and software products are available to  make personal computers easier 
to use for people with disabilities. Among the  different types of products available for the MS-DOS, Windows, 
and Windows  NT operating systems are:
<UL>
<LI>Programs that enlarge or alter the color of information on the screen for people with visual impairments.
<LI>Programs that describe information on the screen in Braille or synthesized speech for people who are blind 
or have difficulty reading.
<LI>Hardware and software utilities that modify the behavior of the mouse and keyboard.
<LI>Programs that enable people to &quot;type&quot; by using a mouse or their voice.
<LI>Word or phrase prediction software that enables people to type more quickly and with fewer keystrokes.
<LI>Alternative input devices, such as single switch or puff-and-sip devices, for people who cannot use a 
mouse or a keyboard.
</UL>
<P>
For more information about third-party utilities, see &quot;Getting More Accessibility Information&quot; later 
in this appendix.
