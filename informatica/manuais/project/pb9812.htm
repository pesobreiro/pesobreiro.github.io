<P>
The DHL Systems executive committee wanted the plans for migrating to the Microsoft Windows 95 platform 
to be thoroughly documented in order to provide a model for future development.
<P>
The final plan had to include fully-mapped details for implementation, precise scheduling reports for all tasks, 
and supporting documentation for every component. Patrick’s group successfully used Microsoft Project to 
meet all of these requirements and more.
<P>
Microsoft Project was able to record every level of detail in the master project schedule. Supporting 
documentation can be included as notes listed under Task Information. For example, under the subproject titled 
&quot;Upgrade 130 personal computers,&quot; a note can be attached that tells the user why this task is 
necessary and why it takes a certain amount of time to complete. Patrick explained that this feature was 
particularly helpful in documenting standards, which require a lot of this type of information.
<P>
Versatility in producing different types of reports was an important consideration in selecting a project 
management program for the company. The team of systems administrators were asked to provide Gantt charts 
and a variety of calendar reports for their plan. Microsoft Project was flexible enough to meet all of their 
reporting requirements.
<P>
Patrick observed that Microsoft Project was much easier to update than other project management programs 
and quickly consolidated information from multiple subprojects into a single report providing a comprehensive 
review. Microsoft Project proved to be a valuable presentation tool that allowed the executive committee to see 
every detail of the solution, from initial testing to final installation of equipment.
