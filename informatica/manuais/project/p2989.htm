<H2>View the Right Set of Project Information</H2>

<P>
If Microsoft Project’s only skill were to store your data out of sight in its database, it wouldn’t be very useful 
as a project management aid. You need to be able to see your project data and add to it, delete it, or modify it as 
circumstances dictate. Microsoft Project has the tools that let you do just that. They are called <I>views</I>.
<P>
Each view gives you a different way of looking at some of the data in the database. The view you choose 
depends on what information you want and the format you want to see it in. You can, for example, use a table 
format or a bar-graph format to see how many hours each resource works during a given time period. You can 
also use views to accomplish specific tasks, such as entering and editing information about tasks and 
resources.
<P>

<P>
Some views show essentially the same information, but in different formats. For instance, you can enter data in 
a column in one view and see it displayed as a bar graph in another view.
<P>

<P>
There are two major categories of views: task views and resource views. Task views show information about 
one or more of your tasks. One of the most often used task views, which you see by default when you start 
Microsoft Project, is the Gantt Chart view. Resource views show information about one or more of the 
resources — people or equipment — you assigned to your project. One example of a resource view is the 
Resource Usage view, which displays work allocations over time for each resource.
<P>
The following tables describe some of the more commonly used task and resource views and the types of 
information they display.
<P>
Use a <I>task view</I> when you want to enter, change, or display task information.
