<H1>Critical Tasks: The Tasks That Make a Difference</H1>

<P>
When you want to shorten your project schedule, where do you begin? You begin by examining your project’s 
<I>critical tasks</I>,<I> </I>the tasks that must finish on time for the entire project to finish on time. The 
project plan’s <I>critical path</I> is the sequence of tasks that ends on the latest finish date. The finish date of 
the last task in the critical path is the project finish date.
<P>
<IMG SRC="1102.GIF" ALT="Image File: 1102">
<P>
By default, a critical task has zero <I>total slack time</I>, which is the amount of time a task can slip before it 
delays the project finish date. If any critical task slips, the project finish date will likely slip as well.
<P>
Critical tasks are like stacked sections of a column holding up a roof. The column is the critical path, and the 
roof represents the project finish date. Noncritical tasks are like decorative columns that are lower than the 
roof. To raise or lower the roof, you adjust the height of the &quot;critical&quot; column.
<P>
<IMG SRC="1103.GIF" ALT="Image File: 1103">
<P>
If you increase the height of a column of noncritical tasks so that the roof rests on it instead, then that column 
becomes &quot;critical.&quot; The original column of critical tasks becomes &quot;noncritical.&quot;
<P>

<P>
Microsoft Project recalculates the critical path every time you change task data. A critical task may become 
noncritical and a noncritical task may become critical as you assign resources, change links, and so on.
<P>
<P>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=5 CELLSPACING=0 border=5 width=30% align=right><TR>
<TD VALIGN=top><Font Face ="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">Decreasing the duration of a noncritical task has 
no effect on the project end date.</FONT></TD>  
</TABLE>You can experiment with your project plan by altering one critical task at a time. Change one element of a 
critical task to see how the change affects the schedule as a whole. For example, you can reduce a task’s 
duration to see if that change causes the project to end sooner. Or, if a resource assigned to work on two 
concurrent tasks becomes overworked, you can reschedule one of those tasks.
<P>
But don’t start altering critical tasks to fine-tune your schedule until you can distinguish critical tasks from 
noncritical ones. Microsoft Project provides several ways for you to display critical tasks and focus on the 
ones to which you should give the most attention.
