<BR>&quot;Microsoft Project allowed us to effectively 
deliver resources and manage them in a timely fashion.&quot;
<P>
The Road Engineering Division of the County of Santa Barbara, CA handles approximately 2,000 projects 
annually with only six engineers and a small staff of supporting personnel.
<P>
A paper tracking system used for project scheduling and staff assignments proved to be inadequate for 
managing the division’s limited resources. The agency needed a system that could quickly assess the impact 
of new projects on the existing workloads of engineers and other available resources.
<P>
Analyst Robert Ooley used Microsoft Project as the planning tool to create a scheduling system that 
automated and improved upon the existing paper tracking system. Robert’s challenge was to develop a system 
that created a master schedule for all department projects and standardized procedures for data input.
<P>
A new system was needed that would correct problems inherent in the existing paper tracking system. A major 
shortcoming was the lack of centralized project management scheduling. Engineers kept their own schedules, 
which required frequent meetings to coordinate dates and details when managing large projects.
<P>
Another problem was that the paper tracking system did not allow the division manager to see a 
comprehensive view of the workloads and schedules for all engineers. This was essential to accurately forecast 
future staffing and resource needs.
<P>
The existing scheduling system was not able to accommodate the changing availability of staff resources 
within the division. Staff contingency assignments made it difficult to predict how many engineers would be 
available to take on new projects. Two engineers take on specialist roles in the event of severe weather or other 
emergencies, which requires that their workloads be shifted or postponed on short notice.
<P>
Robert selected Microsoft Project to develop an automated scheduling system for the division because it was 
able to resolve all of these problems and more.
