<H1>Task Adjustments That Resolve Overallocations</H1>

<P>
Perhaps you have the flexibility to reschedule tasks that are contributing to overallocations, but you don’t 
have extra resources. In this case, you can resolve resource overallocations by adjusting tasks.
<P>
<B>Delay a Task Manually</B>
<P>
Delay a task manually if you want to delay one task at a time, see exactly how this delay affects the project 
schedule, and adjust the delay, if necessary. Delay a task manually until a resource has time to work on it.
<P>
<B>Delay Tasks Automatically</B>
<P>
Delay tasks automatically if you want to resolve a number of overallocated resources all at once. Delay tasks 
automatically by leveling the overallocated resources. Leveling delays or splits certain tasks in your schedule 
until the resources assigned to them are no longer overallocated.
<P>
<B>Cut a Task’s Scope</B>
<P>
Cut a task’s scope if you want to avoid rescheduling a task or increasing its duration. Decrease the amount of 
work required for a task by cutting its scope.
<P>
<B>Split a Task</B>
<P>
Split a task if you want to schedule a resource only for the exact time periods that the resource will actually 
work on a task. Alternatively, you can use this method to assign a different resource to each portion of a task.
