<H2>Works Within Constraints</H2>

<P>
There was no room for planning error in creating a solution for the Microsoft Windows 95 rollout at DHL 
Systems. Patrick’s team had to develop a plan that worked within strict time, cost, and resource constraints. 
Microsoft Project’s ability to show details of task relationships and dependencies allowed planners to create a 
scheduling model that accurately reflected these constraints. The final result of the team’s efforts was a 
realistic model of the project that closely mirrored actual events and data.
<P>
Patrick continues to use Microsoft Project at DHL Systems to create plans for a company-wide transition to a 
major network software application.
