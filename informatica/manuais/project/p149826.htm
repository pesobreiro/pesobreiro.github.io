<H2>Filter Your View Quickly with AutoFilters</H2>

<P>
In addition to standard filters, Microsoft Project also features AutoFilters. One AutoFilter is available for each 
column in every sheet view, except for the Indicators field. Once you select a criterion from a column’s 
AutoFilter list, Microsoft Project displays only those tasks or resources that match the criterion you chose.
<P>
If you select AutoFilters for more than one field, you can narrow the information you view even further. For 
instance, if you set the AutoFilter for the Duration field to greater than 1 week and the AutoFilter for the 
Resource Name field to a particular resource, you can view all tasks assigned to that resource that will take 
more than 1 week to complete.
<P>
The AutoFilter of each field includes All and Custom in its criteria list. By clicking All (the default for all fields), 
you remove the filter criterion from that field. By clicking Custom, you can create your own filter for that field.
<P>
Other than All and Custom, the criteria list varies from field to field. For example, when you click the AutoFilter 
for the Resource Name field, you see a list of all the resources in your current project. In contrast, when you 
click the AutoFilter for the Duration field, you see a list of less-than, greater-than, and equal-to durations (for 
example, &gt; 1 day, &lt;= 1 week), plus all the durations that Microsoft Project detects in your project (even 
those that include a decimal, such as 2.33 days).

<OL>
<LI>If AutoFilters are not turned on, click <B>AutoFilter</B> <img src="filt.gif">.
<LI>In the field to which you want to apply an AutoFilter, click the arrow in the column heading, and then click 
the value for which you want to filter the table.
<BR>The arrow and field name for that column become blue.
<LI>To filter for an additional condition based on a value in another field, repeat step 2 in the other field.
<LI>To filter one field for two values or to apply comparison operators other than <B>Equals</B>, click the 
arrow in the column, and then click <B>Custom</B>.
<LI>If information changes, you can refresh your AutoFilter settings by clicking the arrow again, and then 
reselecting the filtering value.
<LI>To remove the filtering on a specific row, click <B>All</B> in the <B>AutoFilter</B> list for that column.
<LI>To turn off AutoFilters, click <B>AutoFilter</B> <img src="filt.gif"> again.
</OL>
</BOTTOM>
<P>
Note that you can apply up to two conditions to a column with AutoFilter. If you need to apply three or more 
conditions to a column, use calculated values as your criteria, copy records to another location, or use a filter 
that applies three or more conditions.
<P>
If you apply a particularly useful AutoFilter frequently, it may be faster to save it and then apply it as a normal 
filter.
