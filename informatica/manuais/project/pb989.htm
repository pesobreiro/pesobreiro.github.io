<H2>Communicates Priorities</H2>

<P>
Robert explains that another benefit of using Microsoft Project is that projects can automatically be ranked 
according to priorities. This is a particularly important feature for a small engineering department with limited 
staff and financial resources to manage a large number of projects. Engineers must be able to prioritize new 
projects to work within these constraints.
<P>
Microsoft Project helps to communicate priorities by allowing the user to assign rankings to individual tasks as 
they are entered into a schedule. Planners can grade tasks with values ranging from low to high according to 
their importance. Tasks can then be sorted to schedule high-priority projects for completion before lower 
priority projects.
<P>
The Road Engineering Division has used Microsoft Project’s capability to prioritize tasks to improve cash flow 
management. Payment dates are entered as high-priority items into the master schedule. Copies of the payment 
schedules are then sent to the division’s accounting department, ensuring that both engineering and 
accounting staff are kept informed of important payment dates.
<P>
Future cash needs can be assessed with increased accuracy and coordination, eliminating problems of missed 
payments. This is especially important for the Department of Public Works, which receives funding from 
government agencies with lengthy periods of time needed to process funding requests.
<P>
Robert reports that Microsoft Project will be used in the future to expand the use of project management 
systems to other divisions in the Department of Public Works. He plans to revisit the existing scheduling 
system model, make some adjustments, and implement it in the Water Resources and Flood Control and Solid 
Waste and Utilities sections.
