<P>
<B>Scale</B>
<P>
A method for increasing or decreasing the&nbsp;image on a printed page. Decreasing the scale&nbsp;prints 
more of a view or report on each page; increasing the scale prints less of a view or&nbsp;report on each page.
<P>
<B>Schedule</B>
<P>
The timing and sequence of tasks within a project, as well as the project duration. The schedule consists 
mainly of tasks, dependencies among the tasks, durations, constraints, and time-oriented project information.
<P>
<B>Scope</B>
<P>
The combination of all project goals and tasks, and the work required to accomplish them.
<P>
<B>Sheet</B>
<P>
A spreadsheet-like representation (in rows and columns) of task or resource information. Each row specifies an 
individual task or resource, such as the &quot;Design package&quot; task or the Advertising Agency 
resource. Each column specifies a type of information, such as start dates&nbsp;or standard rates.
<P>
<B>Slack time</B>
<P>
The amount of time a task can slip before it affects another task’s dates or the project finish date. See <I>free 
slack</I>, <I>total slack</I>.
<P>
<B>Slippage</B>
<P>
The amount of time a task has been delayed from its original baseline plan. The slippage is the difference 
between the scheduled start or finish date for a task and the baseline start or finish date. Slippage can occur 
when a baseline plan is set and the actual dates subsequently entered for tasks are later than the baseline 
dates&nbsp;or the actual durations are longer than the&nbsp;baseline durations.
<P>
<B>Sorting</B>
<P>
A method of controlling the order in which task, resource, and other information is displayed.
<P>
<B>Split task</B>
<P>
A task divided into two or more portions, with time gaps between one portion and&nbsp;another that indicate 
an interruption in work on the task.
<P>
<B>Static picture</B>
<P>
A snapshot of information, often from another document or program, that is not linked to the document or 
program in which the&nbsp;information was created.
<P>
<B>Static text</B>
<P>
Text in a custom form or dialog box that cannot be edited.
<P>
<B>Status date</B>
<P>
A date that you set (rather than the current date) for the purpose of evaluating and projecting, based on the 
project’s trends so far, where you can expect costs, work, and other aspects of the project to be on the status 
date you&nbsp;set.
<P>
<B>Subproject</B>
<P>
A project inserted into another project. Use subprojects as a way to break complex projects into more 
manageable parts. Also known as an inserted project.
<P>
<B>Subtask</B>
<P>
A task that is part of a summary task. The subtask information is added into the summary task. You can 
designate subtasks using&nbsp;the Microsoft Project outlining feature.
<P>
<B>Successor task</B>
<P>
A task that cannot begin until another task has started or finished. See <I>predecessor task</I>.
<P>
<B>Summary task</B>
<P>
A task that consists of and summarizes a logical group of tasks, called subtasks, and usually represents a 
phase. You can&nbsp;use the Microsoft Project outlining feature to&nbsp;create summary tasks. Microsoft 
Project automatically determines summary task information (duration, cost, and so on) using&nbsp;information 
from the subtasks.
