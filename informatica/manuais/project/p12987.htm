<H2>Delay Tasks Automatically</H2>

<P>
When you have many resource overallocations, you can have Microsoft Project add delay times to those tasks 
automatically. You can then check the results and make adjustments if necessary. This is often faster than 
adding delay to one task at a time.
<P>
In a process called <I>leveling</I>, Microsoft Project delays or splits tasks automatically until the resources 
assigned to them are no longer overallocated. You can prioritize tasks to specify which tasks should be 
delayed first and which should not be delayed at all. You can decide whether to level all resources or only 
selected resources. And you can level with or without delaying the finish date of the schedule. Remember, 
though, you should apply leveling only after analyzing and refining the schedule yourself.
<P>
If you’re scheduling from a finish date, you can still level your project. Earlier versions of Microsoft Project did 
not allow leveling for projects scheduled from a finish date. Leveling tasks in projects scheduled from a finish 
date will have negative delay values applied to them. This will cause a task or resource assignment’s finish 
date to occur earlier because the delay will be applied from the finish of the task or assignment.
<P>
Automatic leveling might not result in the best solution to your problem because Microsoft Project can follow 
only a limited set of fixed rules. It checks predecessor dependencies, slack time, dates, priority, and task 
constraints to determine which tasks to delay. It can’t get creative and substitute a resource on an 
overallocated task or change the task’s duration. Only you know the subtleties of your schedule.
<P>
You should always review the changes Microsoft Project has made when it levels resources by delaying tasks. 
You can review these changes on the Leveling Gantt view. If you don’t like the changes, you can remove them 
at any time.

<LI>On the <B>Tools</B> menu, click <B>Resource Leveling</B>.
<LI>Click <B>Manual</B> to level resources only when you click the <B>Level Now</B> button.
<LI>In the <B>Look for overallocations on a basis</B> box, click a time period to determine the sensitivity with 
which leveling will recognize overallocations.
<BR>Leveling will occur only if a resource is scheduled to do more work than it has the capacity for in the 
specified period.
<LI>Under <B>Leveling range for</B>, select whether you want the entire project leveled or only those tasks 
falling within a specific time period.
<LI>In the <B>Leveling order</B> box, click one of the following leveling orders:
<UL>
<LI>Click <B>ID Only</B> to have Microsoft Project check tasks in the ascending order of their ID numbers 
before considering other leveling criteria to determine which tasks to level.
<LI>Click <B>Standard</B> to have Microsoft Project check tasks in the order of their predecessor 
dependencies, slack, dates, priority, and then task constraints.
<LI>Click <B>Priority, Standard</B> to have Microsoft Project check tasks’ priorities to be leveled before 
considering predecessor dependencies, slack, dates, and then task constraints.
</UL>
<LI>To prevent the finish date of your project from being moved out, select the <B>Level only within available 
slack</B> check box.
<LI>To have leveling adjust when a resource works on a task independent of other resources working on the 
same task, select the <B>Leveling can adjust individual assignments on a task</B> check box.
<BR>When the task’s priority is set to <B>Do Not Level</B>, Microsoft Project will skip the task.
<LI>To interrupt tasks by creating splits in the remaining work on tasks or resource assignments, select the 
<B>Leveling can create splits in remaining work</B> check box.
<LI>Click <B>Level Now</B>.

Immediately after leveling your project, you can undo the action if you don’t get the results you want.

If there are tasks that you prefer not to delay unless absolutely necessary, you can select the order in which 
Microsoft Project delays tasks with overallocated resources. You do this by assigning a higher priority to 
urgent tasks that should start as early as possible.
