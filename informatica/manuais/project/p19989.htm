<H3>What All Workgroup Members Need</H3>

<P>
Workgroup members will need a web browser, a web server, network access and a network identifier, and an 
Internet connection and address. The workgroup manager also needs each of these items, except for the web 
browser.
<H4>Web Browser</H4>
<P>
To display workgroup messages on a web site, team members need a web browser, such as Microsoft Internet 
Explorer.
<H4>Web Server</H4>
<P>
A web server is a computer that connects a workgroup to an intranet or the World Wide Web. It acts as a 
facilitator for delivering workgroup messages among the workgroup members. If you know that your 
organization has a dedicated web server, you can contact your organization’s web server administrator, or 
webmaster,<I> </I>and have that person set up a share volume for your workgroup. (Your webmaster may or 
may not be your system administrator.) You’ll also need to get the web server’s network address (URL) and 
network path (UNC) from the webmaster. Or, by installing Microsoft Personal Web Server (on a computer 
using Windows 95), you can set up a web server on your own computer or on any computer that has access to 
your organization’s intranet.
<H4>Network Access and a Network Identifier (an Intranet Requirement Only)</H4>
<P>
Every computer in the network needs to have a unique network identification so that the workgroup feature 
can identify the participating computers on the network and communicate with them. If you’re unsure about 
whether you’re on a network or what your network identification is, contact your system administrator.
<H4>Internet Connection and Address (a World Wide Web Requirement Only)</H4>
<P>
To operate as a workgroup on the World Wide Web, you and your workgroup members must be connected to 
the Internet. Your organization may have a direct server connection to the Internet, or it may access the 
Internet through an Internet service provider (ISP). If you’re unsure whether you or your workgroup members 
have an Internet connection, contact your system administrator.
