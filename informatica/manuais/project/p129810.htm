You can split, move, recombine, and resplit tasks in several ways:
<UL>
<LI>You can split a task into any number of portions.
<LI>You can remove the split between any two portions and recombine them.
<LI>You can move each portion of a split task independently of the other portions. That is, you can change 
one portion’s start and finish dates without affecting the start and finish dates of the other portions.
<LI>You can move portions and change their durations in the same way you perform these actions for whole 
tasks.
<LI>When you split a task, you don’t change its duration, regardless of the length of the gaps between 
portions. The duration of a split task changes only when you change the duration of a portion.
<LI>You can change the duration of each portion of a split task without affecting the durations of the other 
portions.
<LI>When you split a linked task, the entire task remains linked as a whole task. You cannot link portions of 
the same task or portions from different tasks. If you try to link a portion of one task to a portion of another 
task, Microsoft Project links the whole tasks, not the portions.
</UL>

<P>
If at any time you decide that work on two portions of a split task can occur without a stop period in between, 
you can recombine them.
