<P>
More and more people within and between organizations are working &quot;interactively.&quot; It’s 
becoming unusual to work on a project by yourself or to use only one software program. For example, you may 
need to supply project cost data to accounting personnel who analyze that data using Microsoft Excel. Or, you 
may need to send an entire project plan to a client who doesn’t have Microsoft Project but can view the plan in 
a database program you aren’t familiar with. In these situations and many others, you can share Microsoft 
Project information directly with other programs.
<P>

<P>
When you share information with another program, you either insert Microsoft Project information into that 
program or insert information from that program into Microsoft Project. Text, pictures, numerical data, 
spreadsheets, project calendars, and even entire project files can all be included in other programs. For 
example, if your team leaders use Microsoft Team Manager to track the progress of team members, you can 
update your project plan with this information. Or, to highlight important numerical data in a status report, you 
can put it into Microsoft Excel, show the data as a pie chart, and then insert the pie chart into the Gantt Chart 
view of your project. You can also exchange Microsoft Project data with other database programs that your 
clients use to display and review their project data.
<P>
In fact, most often, exchanging information between Microsoft Project and any other program — Microsoft or 
non-Microsoft — is as easy as placing an apple into a friend’s hand. Just as the apple’s shape fits both your 
hand and your friend’s, so too is project information &quot;shaped&quot; to fit into Microsoft Project as well 
as other programs. Even when information from another program doesn’t have the &quot;shape&quot; or 
format Microsoft Project usually works with, you can convert it to a compatible format.
<P>
You can share information with other programs in a variety of ways:
<UL>
<LI>Copy and paste project information by using the Windows Clipboard.
<LI>Import or export project information.
<LI>Embed objects or create links to project information.
</UL>
<P>
With Microsoft Project, you can choose the information-sharing method that best meets your needs.
