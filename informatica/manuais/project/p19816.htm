<H1>A Sample Listing of Project Management Reference Guides</H1>

<P>
This chapter briefly introduced one effective process for managing projects. In the space of one chapter we 
couldn’t begin to cover project management in as comprehensive a manner as it deserves. To help you get 
more detailed information about project management, we deliver you into the hands of top project management 
experts.
<P>
The following list represents only a small sample of the books available on project management. Inclusion of a
