<P>
<B>Accrual method</B>
<P>
A method that determines when the cost for a resource is incurred, the fixed costs for tasks, and when actual 
costs are charged to a project. You can incur costs at the start or finish of a task or prorate them during 
the&nbsp;task.
<P>
<B>Accrued cost</B>
<P>
A cost that is incurred all at once at&nbsp;a certain time in a project or gradually, for instance, over the entire 
time a task is being worked on. The way a cost is accrued depends on&nbsp;the accrual method you select. 
See <I>accrual method.</I>
<P>
<B>Actual</B>
<P>
Information that shows what has actually occurred. For example, the actual start date for a task is the day on 
which the task actually started, and its actual cost is the amount spent up to the present.
<P>
<B>Assignment</B>
<P>
A specified task assigned to a particular resource.
<P>
<B>Assumption</B>
<P>
An estimate or educated guess about how various factors will affect a project or a task.
<P>
<B>AutoFilter</B>
<P>
A filter, available only in sheet views, that quickly displays tasks or resources that match a criterion associated 
with a specific column. Except for the Indicators column, each column has an AutoFilter associated with it.
