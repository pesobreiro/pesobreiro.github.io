You can create a functional project plan that helps you keep track of tasks and dates without adding resources 
to the plan. But by adding resources, you can use Microsoft Project to its fullest extent. For example, you can 
assign resources to tasks, distribute work evenly, and track resource costs.

<P>
You can use Microsoft Project to create a <I>resource list</I>, which contains the names of the resources that 
are available to your project. Your resource list should include resources sufficient in number and skills to 
accomplish your project goals. While resources usually are the people who will accomplish the tasks, 
resources can also be equipment, a group of people with similar skills (such as a department), or even an empty 
conference room.
<P>
To establish the working and nonworking days and hours of all resources, you specify a <I>project 
calendar</I>, which shows the working days and hours for your entire plan. A project calendar is just one type 
of <I>working times calendar.</I> You can also specify a <I>base calendar</I> for each group of resources, 
say, for various shift workers, as well as a <I>resource calendar</I> for each individual resource. Microsoft 
Project uses working times calendars to schedule tasks.
