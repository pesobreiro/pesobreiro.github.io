<H2>Increase Working Hours</H2>

<P>
Sometimes you just can’t get additional resources for the tasks you want to shorten. One way to handle this 
situation is to reduce the durations of those tasks by increasing the number of working hours for the resources 
already assigned. Increase the number of available hours for a resource by increasing the resource’s working 
hours on his or her resource calendar.
<P>
Microsoft Project calculates a task’s duration based in part on the working hours of assigned resources. For 
example, a painter with a 6-hour working day is assigned full-time to paint gallery walls, a task that requires 12 
hours. The current task duration is 2 days. By increasing the painter’s working day to 8 hours and keeping the 
painter assigned full-time to the task, the task shrinks to 1.5 days.
<P>
Increase the working hours for a resource only if you want the resource to work longer hours on all assigned 
tasks within a given period.
