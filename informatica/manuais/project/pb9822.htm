<BR>&quot;We would not have been able to meet our

<P>
The Weather Channel is a 24-hour, seven-day cable television network devoted entirely to weather which is 
seen by a national audience of 64 million households. The network had outgrown its existing facilities in 
Atlanta, GA, and continuing growth demands prompted a decision to relocate into a larger building. The 
moving process required that all operations of the 24-hour cable television network continue without 
interruption.
<P>
The Weather Channel needed a scheduling tool to plan a seamless move into a remodeled eight-story building. 
This process had to be transparent to viewers, eliminating the possibility of temporarily shutting down 
operations in order to move into the new facility.
<P>
The Weather Channel’s parent company, Landmark Communications Inc., approved the move in March, 1996, 
with a targeted completion date of December 2, 1996. This ambitious schedule placed strict time constraints on 
planning the move.
<P>
The Weather Channel examined several different project management programs before deciding to use 
Microsoft Project to create a master scheduling plan that would coordinate all aspects of the move. Senior Vice 
President of Operations, Mark McKeen, explained that the network selected Microsoft Project because it was 
easy to use yet powerful enough to meet all of the project management requirements involved in such a 
complex endeavor.
