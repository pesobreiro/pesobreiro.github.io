<B>Object</B>
<P>
In object linking and embedding (OLE), information such as a chart or text that is shared among different 
documents and different programs. The program used to create the object and the object type determine the 
programs that can be used to edit the object, as well as how it&nbsp;can be edited.
<P>
<B>Object linking and embedding (OLE)</B>   A protocol that allows information such as a chart or text (called 
an object) to be shared among different documents and different programs. Linking allows information in a 
container document to be&nbsp;updated whenever that information is changed in the source document. 
Embedding allows the information to be edited from within the container document, using the program that 
created the information.
<P>
<B>Objects box</B>
<P>
An area you can display on forms that holds linked or embedded objects.
<P>
<B>Organizer</B>
<P>
The tabbed dialog box in which you can copy custom views, tables, filters, calendars, reports, forms, toolbars, 
maps, and Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications modules to other project documents. To open the Organizer, 
click <B>Organizer</B> on the <B>Tools</B> menu.
<P>
<B>Outdenting</B>
<P>
Moving a task to a higher outline level (to the left) in the Task Name field. When you outdent a task to the 
leftmost position in the column, it is no longer a subtask.
<P>
<B>Outline</B>
<P>
A hierarchical structure for a project that&nbsp;shows how some tasks fit within broader groupings. In 
Microsoft Project, subtasks are indented under summary tasks.
<P>
<B>Outline level</B>
<P>
The number of levels a task is indented from the top level of the outline, where 1&nbsp;is the top level.
<P>
<B>Outline number</B>
<P>
Numbers that indicate the exact position of a task in the outline. When displayed, outline numbers appear to 
the left of each task in task views.
<P>
<B>Overallocation</B>
<P>
The result of assigning more tasks to a resource than the resource can accomplish in the working time 
available. Microsoft Project determines which resources are overallocated based on the work and duration 
values for assigned tasks, the maximum number of units available for the resource, and the calendar 
used&nbsp;by the resource. See <I>underallocation</I>.
<P>
<B>Overtime</B>
<P>
The amount of work beyond a resource’s normal working hours. It is the amount of existing work that is 
considered by Microsoft Project to be overtime work. When overtime hours are entered for a resource, 
Microsoft Project subtracts overtime hours from regular hours before the duration is calculated.
