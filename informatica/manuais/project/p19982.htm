<P>
When the success of your project depends on your team members working together, it may be vital that they 
are able to communicate with one another quickly. Teams can waste valuable time when communications 
systems are slow or restrictive, such as when mailing information to people in different countries.
<P>
Recognizing this, more and more businesses are connecting their team members through electronic 
communications systems. Connecting a project team with an effective means of communicating is essential to 
meeting project goals.
<P>
When Microsoft Project interlinks team members in tightly knit workgroups, it makes it easier for team members 
to exchange information about their project. To use Microsoft Project to exchange information, these 
workgroups must first be connected through some means of electronic communications.
<P>

<P>
Once connected electronically and interlinked, the workgroup can use special Microsoft Project assignment, 
update, and status messages to:
<UL>
<LI>Assign tasks.
<LI>Accept or decline a task assignment.
<LI>Request and submit status reports.
<LI>Send and receive task updates.
</UL>
<P>
To receive and send workgroup messages, team members use electronic inboxes. These inboxes must be 
connected through e-mail, the <I>World Wide Web</I>, or an internal network (an<I> intranet </I>or internal 
web). They can also be connected through all three at the same time.
<P>
The World Wide Web is a system for exploring web sites, including home pages and other documents, that 
reside on the <I>Internet</I>. The Internet links millions of individual computers — as well as thousands of 
computer networks — in a global network that carries all kinds of information. The World Wide Web is the 
most visible and popular component of the Internet. In general, anyone with a computer linked to the Internet 
can view any web site on the World Wide Web. An intranet, on the other hand, is confined to people within an 
organization. It is an internal network with web sites accessible only to members of that organization.
<P>
In addition to exchanging workgroup messages, you can also provide access to other documents from your 
project file, such as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, Microsoft Word documents, and Microsoft Access 
databases. When you click a <I>hyperlink</I> in your project file, you can launch a network document that 
contains valuable information for the entire team. A hyperlink is a portion of text, distinguished by a color, that 
contains a link to another file, or a location within a file, that usually resides on an intranet or the World Wide 
Web. When you click the hyperlink, a web browser will search for and display the document associated with 
the hyperlink.
