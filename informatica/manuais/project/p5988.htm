<H2>Overlap or Delay Tasks</H2>

<P>
Sometimes task links alone might not show accurately when tasks will actually start. For example, in the 
clockwork project, painting the walls precedes hanging the clocks, and those tasks have a finish-to-start link. 
The schedule shows that the clocks will be hung immediately after the painter finishes painting, but that’s 
before the paint has had a chance to dry.
<P>
You can fine-tune task links — and make sure you don’t gum up the clockwork — by using <I>lag time</I> 
and <I>lead time</I>. By using lag time, you can specify a waiting period, or delay, between the finish of a 
predecessor task and the start of a successor task. To avoid making the museum crew crowbar the clocks out 
of hardened paint, the exhibit planner should probably add lag time between painting the walls and hanging the 
clocks.
<P>

<P>
With lead time, you can overlap two tasks so that a successor task starts before the predecessor task finishes. 
The exhibit planner could assign one person to begin hanging labels soon after the first clock is hung.

<P>
After you enter tasks and assign dependencies to them, analyze your schedule and look for instances where 
you can apply lead or lag time. By using lead and lag time, you can make your schedule more accurate, and you 
may be able to shorten it as well.
<P>
You can express lead or lag time as units of time or as a percentage of the predecessor task’s duration. For 
example, the paint on the walls must dry for 1 day before clocks can be hung, so the exhibit manager can 
specify a 1-day lag between painting the walls and hanging the clocks. Or, if the electrician can begin wiring 
display cases after half the cases are installed, the &quot;Install and position case lights&quot; task can start 
when the &quot;Install wood and glass cases&quot; task is 50 percent complete, regardless of the duration of 
the predecessor task.
