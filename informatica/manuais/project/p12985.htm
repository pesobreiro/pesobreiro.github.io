<H2>A Delay You Can Use to Unjam Resources</H2>

<P>
A resource assigned to tasks that overlap might become overallocated during the overlap period. Tasks that 
have a start-to-start link and tasks with lead time are two kinds of tasks that can have overlap time.
<P>
If one of the tasks can start later without making your schedule unacceptably long, you’re in luck. You can 
resolve the overallocation by delaying the task.
<P>
<I>Delay</I> is an extra amount of time you can add between overlapping tasks to ease scheduling constraints 
for an overallocated resource. When you add enough delay time to make the second task start after the first 
task finishes, you fix the problem. The overallocated resource is no longer scheduled to work on both tasks at 
the same time.
<P>

<P>
Delay has the same effect as lag time, but you use each for different purposes. You add lag time between tasks 
to show when those tasks will actually be accomplished. For example, the exhibit planner might add lag time 
between painting a wall and hanging clocks on the wall, because the planner knows the paint will take time to 
dry. You add delay between tasks specifically to resolve a resource overallocation.
<P>
Though you can’t see any difference in the Gantt Chart view between lag time and delay — they both increase 
the gap between task start dates — Microsoft Project tracks each separately. For example, if you add 2 days of 
lag time between two tasks and then add 1 day of delay, Microsoft Project postpones the start of the second 
task from 2 days to 3 days, but still shows only 2 days of lag time in the Lag field and 1 day of delay in the 
Leveling Delay field.
<P>
Microsoft Project provides two ways to add delay time to a task. You can add delay to one task at a time or 
allow Microsoft Project to add delay times to all tasks with overallocated resources all at once.
