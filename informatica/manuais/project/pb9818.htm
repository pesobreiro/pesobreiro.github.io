briefs using Microsoft PowerPoint.&quot;

Litton Industries is a $3.3 billion aerospace and defense company based in Woodland Hills, CA, with principal 
operations throughout the United States, Canada, Germany, and Italy. Litton is organized into product groups 
ranging from navigation, guidance and control systems, and electronic warfare and command to information 
technology and communication systems. Every product group and division is responsible for maintaining and 
reporting on the current status of strategic planning operations.
<P>
The Standards and Resource Management Group serves as a facilitator, providing support for other groups 
and producing a wide range of reports for senior management.
<P>
Strategic planning was reported to senior management on a regular basis by all groups using a paper 
scheduling and tracking system. Keeping top executives informed by presenting only the information they 
needed required a lot of work using the existing system.
<P>
Corporate Program Manager Sergio Cortez explained that one division manager asked his department if there 
was a tool available that could automate the paper scheduling system by producing strategic planning reports 
using a computer. After meeting with the manager and analyzing his scheduling and reporting needs, Sergio’s 
department decided to create a system based on project management software.
<P>
Sergio identified the most important features his company needed in a project management software 
application after meeting repeatedly with the division manager. The software program needed to have output 
capabilities flexible enough to duplicate the reports currently received by senior management. Microsoft 
Project was selected after investigating a number of different software products.
<P>
Preparing these reports using the paper tracking system required extensive effort. Data retrieved from paper 
files had to be entered into a computer, then cut and pasted into a report. The new system needed to simplify 
this procedure and be easy for administrative personnel to learn. Support staff members were expected to 
maintain files once initial schedules were set up.
<P>
The Standards and Resource Management Group wanted to be able to easily update files and transfer 
information to create presentation charts. Sergio found that Microsoft Project fulfilled all of the needs in 
question and more.
