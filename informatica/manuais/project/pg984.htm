<P>
<B>Calculated field</B>
<P>
A field in which the value is determined by Microsoft Project based on information in other fields. Microsoft 
Project recalculates the value either automatically or when you specify, depending on the settings that you 
choose.
<P>
<B>Calculated filter</B>
<P>
A filter that compares the values in two fields for the same task or resource. For example, the Cost Overbudget 
filter compares baseline costs to currently scheduled costs and then displays or highlights only tasks whose 
scheduled costs are higher than their baseline costs.
<P>
<B>Collapsing</B>
<P>
In an outline, hiding the tasks that are subordinate to summary tasks, leaving only the summary tasks visible. 
This shows only the major phases of your project. You can also expand and collapse resources in the Resource 
Usage view.
<P>
<B>Consolidated file</B>
<P>
A file that contains one or more&nbsp;inserted project files. The inserted projects can retain links to their 
source projects so that any&nbsp;changes to the inserted projects in the consolidated file are passed on to 
the source file, and vice versa.
<P>
<B>Constraint</B>
<P>
A restriction or limitation you set on the start or finish date of a task. For example, you can specify that a task 
must start on a particular date or finish no later than a particular date. See <I>inflexible constraint</I>, 
<I>flexible constraint</I>.
<P>
<B>Contour</B>
<P>
The shape of how scheduled work for an&nbsp;assignment is distributed across time. With a contour, you can 
better control how Microsoft Project schedules the work of a resource assigned to a task. Contour examples 
include flat, back-loaded, front-loaded, bell, and turtle.
<P>
<B>Cost</B>
<P>
The total scheduled cost for a task, resource, or&nbsp;resource assignment or for an entire project. Sometimes 
referred to as <I>current&nbsp;cost</I>.
<P>
<B>Cost rate table</B>
<P>
A table containing different rates for a&nbsp;resource, such as the rates for different kinds of&nbsp;tasks and 
for increases or decreases in salary. Microsoft Project uses these rates to calculate costs for tasks.
<P>
<B>Criteria</B>
<P>
In a filter, the instructions that specify which tasks or resources should be displayed when the filter is applied. 
For example, the criterion for the filter Completed Tasks is any task whose percent complete value is 
100&nbsp;percent.
<P>
<B>Critical path</B>
<P>
The series of tasks that must be completed on schedule for a project to finish on schedule. Each task on the 
critical path is a critical task.
<P>
<B>Critical task</B>
<P>
A task that must finish on time for the entire project to finish on time. If a critical task is delayed, the project 
completion date is also&nbsp;delayed. By default, a critical task has zero slack time. A series of critical tasks 
makes up a&nbsp;project’s critical path.
<P>
<B>Current date line</B>
<P>
The dotted vertical line in the chart portion of a Gantt Chart or Resource Graph view indicating the current date.
