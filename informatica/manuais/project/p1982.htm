<P>
Many people who spend part of their work time managing projects shrink from the words &quot;project 
management.&quot; The very idea sounds too big, too complicated, and too time-consuming. In reality, 
though, project management is nothing more than a system for managing tasks, resources, and costs 
efficiently. A good system can help you improve communication and coordination and reduce the overall 
amount of time you spend managing projects. Add Microsoft Project to your project team and you can be even 
more effective in less time.
<P>
In this chapter we introduce you to basic project management concepts as well as to a tried-and-true, four-
phase process for managing projects. You can follow this process as is or adapt it to your particular situation. 
By no means is this chapter meant to be a comprehensive thesis on project management; it’s an introduction 
only. If you want more information, take a look at the list of project management reference books at the end of 
this chapter.
