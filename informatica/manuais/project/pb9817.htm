<H2>Teaches Project Management Software Skills</H2>

<P>
DRI Consulting adds value to their training programs by having students work in a hands-on environment with 
project management software. Students are more receptive to learning the concepts of project management 
with this approach.
<P>
Microsoft Project was well-suited for demonstrating project management software because it is both easy to 
learn and is widely used by many companies. Students only have to learn one program to become productive 
right away because it is used by so many organizations.
<P>
The learning curve for Microsoft Project was very short. Because the program was easy to learn, it did not 
present obstacles that hindered students’ progress in grasping the concepts of project management.
<P>
Dr. Fennig finds that teaching employees how to use project management software enhances their technical 
abilities and also helps to build leadership skills. He also finds that students who become proficient in project 
management skills also become more effective managers in an organization.
<P>
Dr. Fennig plans to continue using Microsoft Project at DRI Consulting for a variety of applications. He 
observes that consultants can use the program as a valuable &quot;toolbox&quot; to produce results that 
reflect a high level of professionalism and expertise.
