<P>
DRI Consulting is a management and organization consulting firm based in Edina, MN, that provides a wide 
range of services, including training for management development and organization development.
<P>
A large Midwestern food company asked DRI Consulting to develop a three-day training program in the 
fundamentals of project management software for a group of 200 members of a trade marketing department.
<P>
DRI Consulting CEO Dr. John Fennig explains that the client company had several objectives in mind for the 
training session. The client’s trade marketing group was rapidly expanding and adding staff members who were 
unfamiliar with the standardized company procedures they needed to perform their jobs.
<P>
The client’s marketing department used a three-step model as its primary mechanism for developing and 
implementing new marketing programs for packaged food products.
<P>
The verbal instruction method used to teach new employees this model was slow and inconsistent. The 
company wanted to automate the process by teaching employees how to use the three-step model and 
implement it by using project management software.
<P>
The challenge for Dr. Fennig was to develop a course curriculum that taught participants the principles of 
project management software, as well as how to use the company’s three-step marketing model.
<P>
Dr. Fennig used Microsoft Project to develop all aspects of the training program. He used the program to teach 
students how to use the company’s three-step model, to teach principles of project management, and to 
instruct them in the use of project management software.
