<H1>Before You Set a Baseline</H1>

<P>
Because the baseline will provide the reference points against which you compare actual project progress, it 
should include your best estimates for task duration, scheduling, resource allocation, costs, and the other 
project variables you want to monitor.
<P>
Baseline information that consistently differs from actual data shows that your original plan is inaccurate. If 
this is the case, don’t worry. At any time during the project you can modify or rework the baseline.
<P>
To help ensure that your baseline information is as accurate as possible, it’s a good idea to double-check your 
project file, even if you’ve already spent a week fine-tuning it. Checking the following items will help ensure 
that your baseline information is accurate:
<UL>
<LI>The project start and end dates have been approved.
<LI>Working times calendars have been adjusted for the project, all groups, and each individual.
<LI>The task list is complete.
<LI>The resource list is complete.
<LI>At least one resource is assigned to each task (except milestones).
<LI>The workload is evenly distributed by resolving any resource overallocations.
<LI>The critical path has been shortened as much as possible.
<LI>Each task link reflects the true task sequence. For example, if two tasks can start at the same time, they are 
linked with a start-to-start dependency.
<LI>No unnecessary contraints have been applied to any tasks.
<LI>All unnecessary slack time has been cut from tasks, and slack remains only in those parts of the schedule 
where it’s needed.
<LI>Estimated project costs are within budget.
</UL>
<P>
For information about how to accomplish the tasks on this list, as well as other schedule refinements, read 
chapters 10 through 13 in <A HREF="nav/CONTENTS.htm#1">Part 3, &quot;Making Your Schedule Lean and 
Mean.&quot;</A>
