<B>UNC</B>
<P>
Universal Naming Convention addresses are&nbsp;used to identify the location of a file that resides on a 
network server. These addresses start with \\ (two backslash characters) and supply the server name, share 
name, and full path to the file. For example, \\server\share\path\project file.mpp is a UNC address.
<P>
<B>Underallocation</B>
<P>
Assigning a resource to work fewer hours than the resource has available. See&nbsp;<I>overallocation</I>.
<P>
<B>Units</B>
<P>
The number of units or the quantity of a resource assigned to a task. For example, if you have a plumbing task, 
you could assign two units, or two plumbers, to the task. If you have one plumber, you could assign 50 percent 
units (half of one plumber’s time) to the task. The maximum units is the maximum number of units available for 
the resource. For example, if you have three plumbers working on a project, the maximum units is 
300&nbsp;percent — three plumbers working full-time.
<P>
<B>URL</B>
<P>
A Uniform Resource Locator address is a standard for naming and locating an object on the&nbsp;Internet, 
such as a file or newsgroup. URLs are used extensively on the World Wide Web and&nbsp;are&nbsp;used in 
HTML documents to specify the&nbsp;target&nbsp;of a hyperlink.
