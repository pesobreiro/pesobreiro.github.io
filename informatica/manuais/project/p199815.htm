<H3>Add a Resource’s Workgroup Identifier to Your Project</H3>

<P>
To ensure that each workgroup message is received by the correct team member, you need to assign each team 
member a unique <I>workgroup identifier</I>. Workgroup identifiers distinguish one workgroup member from 
another.
<P>
By default, Microsoft Project uses a resource’s e-mail name as the workgroup identifier. If an e-mail name isn’t 
available, Microsoft Project uses the names on your resource list (for example, on the Resource Sheet view) as 
the workgroup identifiers to direct messages to the appropriate TeamInboxes. To enable Microsoft Project to 
direct a workgroup message to the correct resource, make sure you give each resource a unique name.
<P>
You can add each resource’s e-mail address to the project. This procedure is necessary only if the resource’s 
e-mail address is not exactly the same as the resource’s name in Microsoft Project. For instance, if a resource’s 
name and e-mail address are both Chris, then you don’t need to perform this procedure. However, if the e-mail 
address is ChrisLu instead of just Chris, then you need to add that resource’s e-mail address.
<P>

<OL>
<LI>On the <B>View Bar</B>, click <B>Resource Sheet</B> <IMG SRC="RESS.gif">.
<LI>On the <B>View</B> menu, point to <B>Table</B>, and then click <B>Entry</B>.
<LI>In the <B>Resource Name</B> field, select a resource whose e-mail address you want to add.
<LI>Click <B>Resource Information</B> <IMG SRC="RESI.gif">, and then click the <B>General</B> tab.
<LI>In the <B>Email</B> box, type the e-mail address for that resource, and then click <B>OK</B>.
<BR>If the resource is located outside your organization, be sure to include the entire address. For example, if 
the resource’s e-mail name is Chris and that resource can be reached through an Internet service provider 
called Provider (whose web server is registered as provider.com), the following address would be correct: 
<BR>Chris@provider.com
<LI>Repeat steps 3 through 5 for all the other resources.
