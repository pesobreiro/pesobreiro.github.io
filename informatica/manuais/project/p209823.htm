<H3>Edit an Object</H3>

<P>
As your project progresses and the project information changes, you’ll inevitably need to edit some of the 
linked objects that you’ve included in your project file, to correspond to these changes. For example, if you 
have included a spreadsheet about costs as an object in your project file, you’ll want to edit the spreadsheet 
data whenever costs change.
<P>
Editing an embedded object has no effect on the source file from which the object was copied. Likewise, 
changes made to the source file are not reflected in objects that have been embedded in Microsoft Project files. 
Linked objects work differently, however, because editing the source information in the source file changes the 
linked information in the destination program.
<P>
If you decide to cancel the link while saving these edits, you delete the source-destination relationship, but the 
existing information remains intact in the destination file. At that point, you can make any changes you want to 
the object in the destination file. Because it is no longer a linked object, those changes will no longer be 
reflected in the source file.
