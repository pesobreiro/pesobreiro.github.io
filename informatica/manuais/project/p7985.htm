<H2>When Is a Set of Resources Not a Resource Group?</H2>

<P>
Typically, a <I>resource</I> <I>set</I> is any collection of resources that share the same skills or attributes 
and that you might assign to the same tasks. For example, if you’re planning to assign five painters to three 
painting tasks, you can create the resource set Painters and assign the set three times rather than assigning 
each individual painter to the three separate painting tasks. You have to make only 3 assignments instead of 
15. (Of course, you can assign fewer than five painters from the set to a task.)
<P>
You create a resource set by naming the set, such as Painters, in the Resource Name field, and then entering a 
number in the Max. Units field in the Entry table of the Resource Sheet view. This is usually x times 100 
percent, where x equals the number of resources in the set. So, a resource set consisting of five painters has a 
value of 500 percent in the Max. Units field.
<P>
A <I>resource</I> <I>group</I>, on the other hand, can consist of any combination of individual resources 
and resource sets and is typically used to categorize resources so that they can be tracked and reported on. 
For example, you might group the resource sets Painters, Plumbers, and Electricians, as well as an individual 
lighting expert, with the resource group Contractors so that you can periodically view or create a report 
showing contractor costs. A resource group can also be a department or a company. You create a resource 
group by entering its name in the Group field, which is located in the Entry table of the Resource Sheet view.
