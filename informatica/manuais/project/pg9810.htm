<B>Import/export map</B>
<P>
A set of instructions that maps for&nbsp;Microsoft Project exactly what types of data you want imported or 
exported. Microsoft Project comes with default import/export maps, or you can customize your own. An 
import/export map can include specific instructions for importing or exporting task, resource, and assignment 
data. Using import/export maps, you can import or export as little or as much data as you want into 
a&nbsp;wide variety of formats.
<P>
<B>Importing</B>
<P>
Transferring data into Microsoft Project from another program, such as Microsoft Excel. When you import 
data, you choose an import/export map that defines how the data in the program from which you’re importing 
should be mapped to information in Microsoft Project. See <I>exporting</I>.
<P>
<B>Indenting</B>
<P>
Moving a task to a lower outline level (to the right) in the Task Name field. When you indent a task, it becomes 
a subtask of the nearest preceding task at a higher outline level.
<P>
<B>Indicators</B>
<P>
Small icons representing information for a task or resource that are displayed in the Indicators field. The 
Indicators field is located to the right of the ID field and appears in a number of tables. When you point to an 
indicator, additional information associated with it is displayed to remind you of important details.
<P>
<B>Inflexible constraint</B>
<P>
A constraint that is inflexible because it ties its task to a date. The inflexible constraints include:
<UL><LI>Finish No Earlier Than (for projects scheduled from the finish date).
<LI>Finish No Later Than (for projects scheduled from the start date).
<LI>Must Finish On (for all projects).
<LI>Must Start On (for all projects).
<LI>Start No Earlier Than (for projects scheduled from the finish date).
<LI>Start No Later Than (for projects scheduled from the start date).</UL>
<P>
<B>Interactive filter</B>
<P>
A filter that displays a dialog box&nbsp;for entering filter criteria each time you apply&nbsp;the filter. For 
example, the Using Resource filter displays a dialog box in which you enter a resource name. Microsoft Project 
then displays all&nbsp;the tasks that are using that resource.
<P>
<B>Interim plan</B>
<P>
A set of task start and finish dates that you can save at certain stages of your project. You can compare an 
interim plan with the baseline plan to monitor project progress or slippage. You can save up to 10 interim plans.
<P>
<B>Internet</B>
<P>
A worldwide network of thousands of&nbsp;smaller computer networks and millions of commercial, 
educational, government, and personal computers. The Internet is like an electronic city with virtual libraries, 
storefronts, business offices, art galleries, and so on.
<P>
<B>Intranet</B>
<P>
Any network that provides similar services within an organization to those that are provided by the Internet 
outside the organization. However, an organization’s intranet may or may not be connected to the Internet. For 
example, a company might set up one or more web servers on an internal network where information, formatted 
in HTML for web display, is distributed within the company. Also known as an <I>internal web</I>.
