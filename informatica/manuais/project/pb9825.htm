<P>
Mark McKeen noted that the decision to use project management software would require department managers 
to learn how to use the program quickly. A short learning curve was an important requirement in The Weather 
Channel’s selection process for project management software.
<P>
Microsoft Project was selected over other project management software because it was easier to learn and has 
an interface shared by other Microsoft products, which helped to speed up the learning process. Mark added 
that Microsoft Project is a widely distributed off-the-shelf software product with plentiful training and support 
resources available.
