<H2>Increased Customer Satisfaction</H2>

<P>
Adkim uses Microsoft Project in a number of different ways to boost customer satisfaction for both new and 
existing customers. During initial sales calls, Norm makes a presentation using a Microsoft Project schedule 
which never fails to impress customers. The ability to instantly display tangible deliverables conveys a sense 
of professionalism.
<P>
Microsoft Project can also maximize the potential of all customer inquiries. Norm created a routine that maps 
more than 200 steps that help market the company’s services, from the point of initial customer contact, to final 
completion of construction.
<P>
The process starts with the initial customer contact which automatically generates a follow-up letter enclosed 
with marketing literature and customer references.
<P>
Microsoft Project has proved to be extremely versatile for a small company like Adkim that must maximize its 
resources. Adkim uses it as an important presentation tool, a cost-estimator, and a marketing tool in addition to 
its primary function as a project management tool.
<P>
The ability to track baseline data is another feature that provides a number of useful applications.
<P>
Adkim conducts a &quot;post-mortem&quot; review of every completed project and uses baseline data to 
identify changes that may have caused problems that can be eliminated. This analysis of past performance 
removes obstacles to increased customer satisfaction.
<P>
Norm uses Microsoft Project to give customers a visual picture of any changes made against a baseline time 
schedule. Customers often decide to have changes made to a remodeling project after it has started and want 
to know how the changes will impact the schedule. Contractors can protect themselves with added 
accountability by using Microsoft Project to track all changes requested by customers and show variances 
from the original schedules.
<P>
Norm reports that Microsoft Project is easy to learn thanks to tutorials, help files, and wizards that assist users 
in creating schedules. The familiar features it shares with other Microsoft products, like Word and Microsoft 
Excel, help to speed the learning process. Norm notes that Microsoft Project is not a program he will outgrow 
and he has yet to tap the full potential of its powerful features.
<P>
Norm has used Microsoft Project with other Microsoft products to take important data with him while in the 
field making site inspections. He exports milestones from Microsoft Project to Microsoft Schedule+ and 
transfers data into his Timex Data Link Watch. This allows him to show progress payments or other critical 
parts of a construction project while he is away from his office. In the future, 
<P>
Norm plans to integrate CAD/estimating programs that link data elements to Microsoft Project, which will 
provide Adkim with even greater control over project management.
