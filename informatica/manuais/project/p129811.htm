<H1>Assignment Adjustments That Resolve Overallocations</H1>

<P>
If you have extra resources to assign or resources you can shift from one task to another, you can resolve 
resource overallocations by changing assignments. When you combine adjusting tasks with changing 
assignments, you have a very powerful antidote to overallocation.
<P>
If, however, you can’t adjust tasks, shifting and reassigning resources can resolve most or all of your resource 
overallocations. These are the most effective methods for adjusting assignments. Be aware, however, that 
some of the methods you use to resolve overallocations may cause task durations, and perhaps the project 
duration, to increase.
<P>
<B>Shift Resources</B>
<P>
You can shift resources from noncritical tasks to critical tasks as long as this doesn’t inadvertently change the 
noncritical tasks into critical ones.
<P>
<B>Reassign Resources to Work Part-Time</B>
<P>
You can reassign resources to work part-time if resources are overallocated and you don’t want to reschedule 
any of their assigned tasks or remove them from any of the tasks.
<P>
<B>Reassign Underallocated Resources</B>
<P>
You can assign underallocated resources to tasks that are scheduled to be completed by overallocated 
resources. Use this method if there are resources with available time who are qualified to perform some of the 
tasks of the overallocated resources.
