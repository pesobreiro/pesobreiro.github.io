<H1>The Power of Linking</H1>

<P>
To enable Microsoft Project to start each task at its proper time, you need to <I>link</I> the tasks to each 
other, based on their start and finish dependencies.
<P>

<P>
For example, a clockwork exhibit crew will hang the clocks only after painting the walls. The task of hanging 
clocks is linked to the task of painting walls, because the start date for hanging clocks can occur only after the 
finish date for painting walls.
<P>

<P>
Once these tasks are linked, Microsoft Project will always schedule the start date for hanging clocks relative to 
the finish date for painting walls, no matter when these tasks occur. Thus, they avoid being tied (perhaps 
unrealistically) to a specific date. For example, if the original finish date for painting the walls is February 3, 
then the start date for hanging the clocks is February 3 or later. If painting the walls gets delayed 5 days later 
than originally planned, then Microsoft Project automatically gives hanging the clocks a new start date of 
February 8 or later.
<P>

<P>
The power of linking tasks is twofold:
<UL>
<LI>You can let Microsoft Project calculate all dates for you: task start and finish dates, as well as the project 
finish date. You won’t worry about clocks being hung before walls are painted, because linking maintains the 
proper order of tasks as scheduling changes occur.
<LI>You can see instantly how changes in the start, finish, and duration of a task affect related tasks and the 
schedule as a whole.
</UL>
<P>
When necessary, you can exercise even finer control by specifying overlaps and time gaps between tasks. The 
amount of overlap between two tasks is called <I>lead time</I>. The time gap, or delay, between tasks is called 
<I>lag time</I>. With Microsoft Project, you can add lead or lag time between any two linked tasks.
