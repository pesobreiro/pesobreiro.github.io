<H1>Create a Resource List for Your Project</H1>

<P>
Once you’ve decided which resources to include in your project, you need to add them to your project plan. 
Using Microsoft Project, you have two methods for adding resources. If you have fewer than 10 or so 
resources, you can add them one at a time as you assign resources to tasks. If your project includes more than 
10 resources, you’re better off creating a resource list before you assign resources to tasks. Adding all 
resources to your project plan at once by creating a resource list takes less time than adding one resource at a 
time as you assign resources to tasks.
<P>
A resource list includes:
<UL>
<LI>The name of the resource, which can be a person, a piece of equipment, or a group of interchangeable 
resources, such as pilots.
<LI>The maximum amount of time per day a resource is available to work.
</UL>
<P>
Some tasks might require more than one resource. For example, five painters might be needed to paint the walls 
of a museum gallery. Most likely, they will either work on the same task or on closely related tasks. There’s no 
point in assigning each painter one at a time and tracking his or her work separately. To make it easy to assign 
and track the work of those resources who work together on the same kinds of tasks, you can create sets of 
resources, each set with its own name.

Grouping resources makes reporting easier in some cases. For example, if you enter cost information into your 
plan, you can pull together reports on the costs or schedules for each resource set.
