<H2>Break a Large Task into Smaller Tasks</H2>

<P>
Not all critical tasks are necessarily created equal. Most of the ones in your schedule probably do correspond 
to a concrete, narrowly defined set of actions. But some might actually correspond to several smaller but still 
significant tasks, each of which should be included in your project plan as a separate task, and which you can 
then schedule more flexibly than one large task. If that’s the case, you can break down these overly large tasks 
into smaller subtasks.
<P>

<P>
Some of the subtasks may not need to be completed in sequence for the work to progress, so you may be able 
to shorten the critical path by making some of the subtasks noncritical. Even if some of the subtasks are 
critical, you might be able to overlap them or change the link type. Smaller, overlapping subtasks can have a 
shorter total duration than the original longer task.
<P>
Typically, when you use Microsoft Project to break a large task into smaller tasks, you make the large task a 
summary task by adding subtasks.
