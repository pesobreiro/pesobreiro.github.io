After you’ve entered and linked tasks, added task-duration estimates, and assigned resources, Microsoft 
Project can build an accurate project schedule for you. That might be all the help you want or need to manage a 
particular project. But for projects in which it’s important to know how much money you’ll spend and when 
you’ll spend it, you can add cost information to your project plan. You can also use this feature to help you 
estimate how much future projects will cost.
<P>

<P>
When you add cost information to your plan, you can:
<UL>
<LI>Assign resource costs.
<LI>Determine the cost of each task.
<LI>Estimate the total project cost, which you can use to develop a budget.
<LI>View the cost to date of a specific task or of the project as a whole.
<LI>Control how costs are accrued.
<LI>Determine whether you can hire extra resources to accelerate the schedule — without going over budget.
</UL>
<P>
Where do costs come from? In many projects, the effort to accomplish tasks takes the biggest bite out of the 
budget. The total cost of each task is equal to its <I>variable costs</I> (costs that change over time), plus its 
<I>fixed costs</I> (costs that stay the same over time). The most common variable cost is for paid resources, 
for example, a painter who costs $15 per hour. The longer the painter takes to paint a wall, the more that task is 
going to cost. A common fixed cost is the cost of materials. The amount of paint (and thus the cost) required to 
paint a wall remains the same no matter how long the painter takes.
<P>
To monitor costs effectively, you should first assign rates to resources. You’ll assign hourly rates to some 
resources and <I>per-use</I> <I>costs</I> to others. An example of a per-use cost is the flat amount you pay 
each time you rent equipment or office space. If a resource works on two or more different types of tasks, each 
one requiring a different set of skills, you can assign that resource a different rate for each task. You can also 
specify pay increases (or decreases) that go into effect at a particular time. When you’ve finished assigning 
resource costs and materials costs, and you’ve assigned resources to tasks, Microsoft Project can show you 
the total project cost. From that estimate, you can develop a project budget.
<P>
As your project progresses, you might want to know how much a specific task has cost so far. Microsoft 
Project helps you determine this by giving you a choice of methods for accruing costs.
