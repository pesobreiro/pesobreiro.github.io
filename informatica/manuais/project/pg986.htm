<P>
<B>Earned value</B>
<P>
A measure of the value of work performed so far. Earned value uses your original estimates and your progress 
to date to show whether the actual costs incurred are on budget and whether the tasks are ahead of or behind 
the baseline plan.
<P>
<B>Effort-driven scheduling</B>
<P>
The default method of&nbsp;scheduling in Microsoft Project, by which the&nbsp;duration of a task shortens 
or lengthens as resources are added to or removed from a task while the amount of effort necessary to 
complete the task remains unchanged. For example, a task may require 32&nbsp;hours of work to be 
completed, but the task may be scheduled with a duration of 2&nbsp;days. This indicates that more than one 
resource needs to be assigned to this task, namely two. Working 8&nbsp;hours a day on the task, two people 
would complete the task in 2&nbsp;days. If one resource is removed from the task, the duration would 
lengthen to 4&nbsp;days, while the effort necessary to&nbsp;complete the task (32&nbsp;hours) would 
remain unchanged.
<P>
Effort-driven scheduling applies only to resources being added to or removed from a task. It does 
not&nbsp;apply to Microsoft Project’s calculation rules when changing work, duration, and unit values 
for&nbsp;resources already assigned to tasks.
<P>
<B>Elapsed duration</B>
<P>
The amount of time needed to complete a task, based on a 24&#151;hour day and a 7&#151;day week, 
including holidays, weekends, and other nonworking days. See <I>duration</I>.
<P>
<B>Embedding</B>
<P>
A form of copying in which the copied object resides in the destination file only,&nbsp;with no link to the 
source file, but can be&nbsp;edited using the same tools available in the source&nbsp;file. Changes made to 
an embedded object&nbsp;exist only within the destination file and do&nbsp;not change the source file from 
which the object was copied. Likewise, changes made to the&nbsp;source file are not reflected in the 
embedded object. See <I>linking</I>.
<P>
<B>Entered field</B>
<P>
A field in which you type information.
<P>
<B>Expanding</B>
<P>
In an outline, making visible the&nbsp;collapsed tasks that are immediately subordinate to summary tasks. 
You can also expand and collapse resources in the Resource Usage view.
<P>
<B>Export table</B>
<P>
The Microsoft Project table used to&nbsp;export data in the MPX file format for use in another program.
<P>
<B>Exporting</B>
<P>
Transferring data from Microsoft Project to another program, such as Microsoft Excel. When you export data, 
you choose an import/export map that matches the arrangement of data in the program to which you’re 
exporting. See&nbsp;<I>importing</I>.
