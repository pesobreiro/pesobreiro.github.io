<H1>Modify a Resource’s Working Time</H1>

<P>
Perhaps you have adjusted tasks as much as you can and still have overallocated resources. If all of your 
resources are assigned to work all of their available hours and your budget doesn’t permit you to add more 
resources, there is still something you can do. As a last resort, you can resolve overallocations by increasing 
the amount of available time resources can work — in short, by changing the working times of resources.
<P>
You can increase the amount of available working time in two ways.
<P>
<B>Schedule Longer Working Hours or Additional Shifts</B>
<P>
You can schedule longer working hours or additional shifts to increase a resource’s available work hours so 
that the amount of time the resource is overallocated is reduced or eliminated.
<P>
<B>Vary the Number of Hours a Resource Works on a Task</B>
<P>
You can vary the number of hours a resource works on a task to precisely match the number of hours a 
resource is assigned to spend on a task each day with the number of hours the resource actually does spend 
on the task. This will perhaps free up some extra time for the resource.
<P>
You can use these methods singly, in combination with each other, and with other methods described in this 
chapter.
