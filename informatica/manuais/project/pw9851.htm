<H3>Icons That Alert You to Task, Resource, and Assignment Status</H3>

<P>
If there’s anything out of the ordinary you need to know about a task, resource, or assignment, you’ll see one 
or more icons displayed in the Indicators field for that task, resource, or assignment. (The column heading of 
the Indicators field contains <img src="inf.gif">.) These icons are called indicators.
<P>
There are 13 indicators for tasks and 5 indicators for resources. Each indicator represents a particular kind of 
information. For example, a check mark indicates that a task has been completed. Other indicators inform you 
that a task recurs periodically (such as a weekly meeting), a resource has yet to accept an assignment, a note is 
attached to a task or resource, or that a resource is overworked.
<P>
By positioning the pointer over an indicator, a tip appears. Depending on the kind of information represented 
by the indicator, the tip may be informational (&quot;This task occurs 12 times between 3/4/98 and 
8/7/98.&quot;) or instructional (&quot;This resource should be leveled based on a Day by Day 
setting.&quot;).
