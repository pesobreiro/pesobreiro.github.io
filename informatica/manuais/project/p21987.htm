<H1>Break a Large Project into Smaller Projects</H1>

<P>
It’s usually relatively easy to develop, track, and manage projects that contain several dozen or even a few 
hundred tasks. But very large projects — those that include many hundreds or even thousands of tasks — can 
stretch anyone’s ability to manage well. If you’re dealing with a very large project, especially one that consists 
of logically separate portions or phases, or involves several project leaders, you may want to break the project 
into smaller projects that are combined in a consolidated project.
<P>
When you break down a very large project, you typically want to show the dependencies between the inserted 
projects. This makes sense because the inserted projects are often closely related portions of a larger project. 
You show dependencies by ordering the inserted projects logically (for example, Phase 1 before Phase 2, and 
so on), placing them at the correct outline level (for example, Subphase A under Phase 1), and linking individual 
tasks between projects to show scheduling dependencies (for example, Task 9 in Phase 1 must finish before 
Task 6 in Phase 3 can begin).
