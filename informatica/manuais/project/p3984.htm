<H2>Goals</H2>

<P>
The specific results you want your project to accomplish are your project’s goals. They define your project’s 
purpose.
<P>
Your project’s results can be only as good as its stated goals. Vaguely stated goals often lead to vague results. 
For example, the goal &quot;Set up a clockwork exhibit&quot; doesn’t include a deadline, which makes it 
difficult to determine how many people would be needed or what the project scope might be. Also, it doesn’t 
tell the project team what kinds of clocks to exhibit. But &quot;Set up an exhibit of 75 antique clocks in the 
main hall by October 15&quot; can help determine specific project requirements.
<P>
By stating your project goals in clear and specific terms:
<UL>
<LI>You and your team know exactly what you’re trying to accomplish and why, so you stay focused during 
the course of the project.
<LI>You can estimate your project scope and required resources accurately.
<LI>Your goals become measurable in terms of time, cost, quality, and quantity.
<LI>You can judge whether the goals are realistic and achievable.
<LI>You can determine when the project should be finished.
