<P>
Microsoft Project proved to be an ideal planning design tool for the marketing group’s training procedures. 
Microsoft Project’s modular file structure was easily adapted to fit each of the three steps of the client 
company’s marketing model.
<P>
The marketing model is used by the company’s brand managers to launch new products and is based on three 
steps that involve increasingly detailed levels of retail planning. Microsoft Project was powerful enough to 
document every level of detail from all three steps.
<P>
Each step in the marketing model can be represented in Microsoft Project as a subproject with its own tasks 
and milestones. The first step, called &quot;Basis for Interest,&quot; determines whether there is sufficient 
interest and resources available to move the concept forward to the next step.
<P>
The second step, called &quot;Basis for Marketing,&quot; identifies the tasks needed to implement a 
marketing plan for the product. The third and final step of the model is &quot;Basis for National Rollout of 
Product,&quot; which is the most detailed picture of a product marketing plan. Microsoft Project effectively 
outlined the sequence of tasks required by the model and the resources needed for each step.
<P>
Dr. Fennig observed that Microsoft Project’s flexible output options enabled him to show any level of detail for 
the marketing model. This allowed him to present views that thoroughly explain the model and met the needs of 
everyone in the class.
<P>
Microsoft Project was valuable for improving training procedures that ensured employees had a solid 
understanding of the company’s primary planning vehicle for introducing new products.
