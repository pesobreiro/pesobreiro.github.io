<P>
<B>Field</B>
<P>
A location in a sheet, form, or chart that contains a specific kind of information about a task or resource. In a 
sheet, for example, a field is&nbsp;the intersection of a column and a row. In a&nbsp;form, a field is a named 
box or a place in a column. In a PERT chart, fields are contained in&nbsp;each PERT box.
<P>
<B>File format</B>
<P>
The particular way in which information is stored in a file. Different programs use different file formats and file 
name extensions to indicate these formats.
<P>
<B>File name</B>
<P>
The name of a file. Valid file names can&nbsp;contain up to 255 characters, can have any combination of 
letters or numbers, and can be followed by an extension (a period and one to three characters). The following 
characters and symbols can also be used in a file name:!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~
<P>
<B>Filter</B>
<P>
A tool used to display or highlight specific tasks or resources. For example, when you apply the Critical filter, 
only critical tasks are displayed. See <I>AutoFilter, calculated filter, interactive filter, standard filter</I>.
<P>
<B>Fixed cost</B>
<P>
A cost that stays the same over time, such as that for materials, regardless of the task duration or how much 
work a task requires. See <I>prorated cost</I>, <I>total cost</I>.
<P>
<B>Fixed-duration scheduling</B>
<P>
A scheduling method in&nbsp;which the duration for a task remains the same regardless of the number of 
resources assigned to the task.
<P>
<B>Fixed-duration task</B>
<P>
A task in which the duration is a fixed value and any changes to the work or the assigned units on the task 
don’t affect the task’s duration. See <I>task type</I>.
<P>
<B>Fixed-units task</B>
<P>
A task in which the assigned units (or resources) is a fixed value and any changes to the amount of work or the 
task’s duration don’t affect the task’s units. See <I>task&nbsp;type</I>.
<P>
<B>Fixed-work task</B>
<P>
A task in which the amount of work is a fixed value and any changes to the task’s duration or the number of 
assigned units don’t affect the task’s work. See <I>task type</I>.
<P>
<B>Flexible constraint</B>
<P>
A constraint that is flexible and does not tie its task to a date. The flexible constraints are:
<UL>
<LI>As Soon As Possible (for all projects).
<LI>As Late As Possible (for all projects).
<LI>Finish No Earlier Than (for projects scheduled from the start).
<LI>Finish No Later Than (for projects scheduled from the finish).
<LI>Start No Earlier Than (for projects scheduled from the start).
<LI>Start No Later Than (for projects scheduled from the finish).</UL>
<P>
<B>Footer</B>
<P>
Text that appears at the bottom of every&nbsp;printed page. A footer typically contains information such as 
page number, total page count, and date. See <I>header</I>.
<P>
<B>Form</B>
<P>
A type of view that gives you detailed information about a task or resource.
<P>
<B>Free slack</B>
<P>
The amount of time a task can slip&nbsp;without delaying another task. For a task without successors, free 
slack is the amount of time the task can be delayed without delaying the&nbsp;finish date of its project. See 
<I>slack time</I>, <I>total&nbsp;slack</I>.
