<H1>By Web or Intranet Only: Managing Tasks in the WebInbox and the TeamInbox</H1>

<P>
The WebInbox is located within Microsoft Project. It’s used by the workgroup manager to receive and store 
responses to the TeamAssign, TeamUpdate, and TeamStatus messages that he or she sends to the team 
members. The WebInbox can receive only those workgroup messages that a team member sends from a 
TeamInbox. Messages sent directly from an e-mail program never appear in a WebInbox.
<P>

<P>
When communicating across a web — whether it’s an intranet or the World Wide Web — all workgroup 
members must have access to a common web server. When you set up Microsoft Project to use web 
communications, Microsoft Project installs the TeamInbox on the web server. Using Microsoft Project, you can 
then send workgroup messages, such as task assignments, to workgroup members. These messages are 
posted in the TeamInbox.
<P>
Workgroup members do not use Microsoft Project to access the TeamInbox. Rather, they use their web 
browser to open the TeamInbox. This is similar to how they would access any other web site, except that the 
TeamInbox has a logon password to make the site secure. Once workgroup members log on, they will see any 
workgroup messages that the workgroup manager has sent to them.
<P>
Workgroup members use the TeamInbox to:
<UL>
<LI>Update task status and send the new status to the workgroup manager.
<LI>Delete tasks that have been cut or completed.
<LI>Change the TeamInbox password to protect message security.
</UL>
