<H1>Determine the True Length of a Schedule with Slipped Tasks and Inflexible Constraints</H1>

<P>
As you track progress by entering actual start and finish dates for tasks, you may find that the project finish 
date remains the same, even when a number of tasks have been completed later or have taken longer than 
originally planned. The reason could be that one or more tasks in your schedule have an inflexible constraint 
(Must Start On, Must Finish On, Start No Later Than, Finish No Later Than) applied.
<P>
A task with an inflexible constraint doesn’t move, even if predecessor tasks finish later than planned. A task 
with a Must Start On constraint, for example, doesn’t get &quot;pushed&quot; to a later start date if tasks that 
precede it finish later than their original finish dates. Instead, it remains firmly anchored to its specified start 
date while predecessor tasks move.
<P>
<IMG SRC="1105.GIF" ALT="Image File: 1105">
<P>
The tasks that follow the inflexible task remain unaffected by the late-starting tasks. Therefore, even though 
tasks that precede the inflexible task are late, and the project as a whole is late, Microsoft Project may show 
your schedule incorrectly on the original project finish date. Because of the task with the Must Start On 
constraint, Microsoft Project can’t recalculate a more realistic project finish date.
<P>
What do you do if you want to know the &quot;real&quot; project finish date? You can allow the inflexible 
task to move without removing its Must Start On constraint. You can choose to make schedule changes 
override constraints.
<P>
By default, Microsoft Project honors constraint dates. The start and finish dates of a linked task with an 
inflexible constraint, such as Must Start On, stay the same even if the schedule changes. If you want Microsoft 
Project to automatically recalculate a constrained task’s start and finish dates when the schedule changes, you 
can choose to have schedule changes override constraint dates. Because tasks with flexible constraints such 
as As Soon As Possible and As Late As Possible have no fixed dates to honor, they behave the same way 
regardless of the option you choose.
<P>
When you use constraints in your project plan, you can choose to have schedule changes override 
constraints or have constraints override schedule changes — for all affected tasks. A project plan cannot 
accommodate both options at the same time.
