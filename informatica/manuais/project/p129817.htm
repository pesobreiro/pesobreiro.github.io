<H2>Assign a Resource to Variable Work Hours for a Task (Resource Contouring)</H2>

<P>
At times your schedule may show that each overallocated resource is scheduled to work all available work 
hours. How can you use existing resources to resolve overallocations? It’s possible to free up the time of some 
resources by assigning them to their tasks only for the number of hours they will actually spend on the task 
each day. Closely matching a resource’s assigned hours on a task to the actual hours spent on the task each 
day is called <I>resource contouring</I>.
<P>
When you assign a resource to a task, Microsoft Project automatically assigns the same number of hours per 
time period throughout the duration of the task. This is known as a flat contour. You can change this behavior 
to more accurately reflect how a resource’s work will be patterned throughout the duration of a specific task.
<P>

<TABLE CELLPADDING=5 CELLSPACING=0 border=5 width=30% align=right>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=top><Font Face ="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">If several resources are assigned to one task, you 
can contour each resource’s time independently.</FONT></TD>  
</TABLE>You can select one of several predefined work contours to apply to a particular resource working on a 
particular task. You pick the contour that best matches the way the resource will actually work on the task. This 
allows you to fine-tune a resource’s allocated hours, possibly freeing up time that that resource can use on a 
different task, one with overallocated resources.

<BR>Resources are grouped under the tasks to which they are assigned.
<LI>In the <B>Task Name </B>field, select a resource for which you want to apply a preset work contour.

<LI>To change the start and finish dates for the resource assignment, click the new dates in the <B>Start</B> 
and <B>Finish</B> boxes.
</OL>
</BOTTOM>
<P>
When working with work contours, keep the following in mind:
<UL>
<LI>Once you’ve applied a specific contour to a task, adding new total work values for the task will 
automatically reapply the preset work contour pattern for the task and resources. Microsoft Project will first 
distribute the new task work values across the affected time span, and then assign new work values to the 
resources working on the task.
<LI>If you change the start date of a task or the start date of a resource’s work on a task that has a preset 
contour applied to it, the contour will automatically shift and be reapplied to include the new date. All work 
values within the timespan will receive new values to preserve the pattern of the original contour.
<LI>Once you manually edit a work value on the timescale portion of a view that has a preset contour applied 
to it, the preset contour pattern will no longer be automatically applied. You can, however, reapply the preset 
contour to redistribute the new values.
<LI>If you increase the duration of a task, the preset contour will be stretched to include the new timespan.
<LI>If actual work has been entered, any changes to the task’s total work or to the total remaining work will be 
automatically redistributed to the remaining work values and not to the actual work.
