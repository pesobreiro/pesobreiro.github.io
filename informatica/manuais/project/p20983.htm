<H1>The Different Ways to Share Information</H1>

<P>
With just about every project, you’ll provide information to a variety of people, at least some of whom will use 
programs other than Microsoft Project to work with the data.
<P>
When you think of sharing project information, perhaps the first examples that come to mind are walking down 
the hallway to talk to a colleague or phoning a client about project status. In these situations, you’re 
conveying project information in a <I>static</I> form: your colleague or client can hear it, but can’t revise it 
and return a revised version to you.
<P>
With Microsoft Project, you can provide an <I>editable</I> form of project communication that can be shared. 
Any one of several methods of exchanging information will enable the receiver to view, edit, and return the 
revised version — or send it on to anyone else who has a program that can &quot;read&quot; the file.
<P>
Use the following table to help determine which information-sharing method will meet your needs in various 
situations.
