<H1>Copying Graphics Between Programs</H1>

<P>
Although Microsoft Project provides a number of ways to format your views, you may not be able to create 
exactly the image you want with Microsoft Project alone. You might want to add a graphic created in another 
program.
<P>
Likewise, you might want to enhance another program with a graphic that can be created most easily in 
Microsoft Project. For example, you might want to add a Microsoft Project graphic of resource costs to a 
Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.
<P>
With Microsoft Project, you can copy selected portions of your project plan into another program. It’s also 
easy to copy a graphic from another program into your project plan.
<P>
Graphical information is copied between Microsoft Project and other programs as a <I>static picture</I> only 
— a snapshot of information that’s not linked to the document in which it was created. You may, however, be 
able to edit the copied picture by double-clicking it and using the available editing tools.
