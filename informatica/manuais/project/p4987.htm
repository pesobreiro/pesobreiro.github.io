<H1>The Core of Your Project Plan: The Task List</H1>

<P>
Without a grocery list, you might not remember all the ingredients you need to buy for tonight’s dinner. 
Without a task list, you might leave out some of the tasks that need to be performed to achieve your project 
goals. The task list is the core of your project plan. It consists of all the tasks, phases, and milestones required 
by your project.
<P>

<P>
To create an effective task list, use the following rules of thumb:
<UL>
<LI>Include only tasks that are critical to the completion of your project.
<LI>Add tasks that are significant, yet detailed enough that the time to complete each one is short compared to 
the overall project length.
<LI>Build in phases and milestones.
<LI>Remember tasks that occur repetitively, such as weekly meetings, status reporting, and anticipated 
revision work.
</UL>
<P>
In Microsoft Project, you enter and work with tasks mainly in the Gantt Chart view. As you create your task 
list, you can easily refine it by adding milestones, entering tasks that occur at regular intervals, entering the 
estimated time each task will take, and deleting unnecessary tasks.
