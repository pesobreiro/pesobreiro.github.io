<H2>Decrease a Resource’s Work on a Task</H2>

<P>
If a resource is overallocated and you don’t want to reschedule or remove some of the resource’s tasks, and 
you can’t allow the durations of the tasks to increase, there’s another option. You can decrease the scope of 
one of the resource’s tasks during the period of overallocation, and thus reduce the amount of work required of 
that resource.
<P>
When you decrease the total work on a task, Microsoft Project (by default) decreases the duration of the task.

<OL>
<LI>On the <B>View Bar</B>, click <B>Resource Usage</B> <img src="resu.gif">.
<BR>Tasks are listed underneath the resources to which they are assigned. Overallocated resources are 
highlighted in red and displayed with an icon in the <B>Indicators</B> field.
<LI>In the <B>Work</B> field for the tasks to which the overallocated resource is assigned, type a lesser 
value until the overallocation is removed.
</OL>
<P>
For each resource, the Resource Usage view shows the total hours the resource is working, the hours the 
resource is working on each task, and the hours worked per time period on the timescale. You can see a 
graphical representation of overallocated resources in the Resource Graph view.
<P>
You may want the duration of a task to remain the same after you decrease the work assigned to it. When you 
decrease the work assigned to a task that has a fixed duration, Microsoft Project decreases the resource units 
assigned to the task. For example, a resource is assigned to a 2-day task at 100 percent resource units. If you 
decrease the total amount of work for that task to 1 day but still want the work to be completed in 2 days, 
Microsoft Project automatically reduces the resource’s units on that task to 50 percent. That is, the resource is 
now assigned to work on the task half-time on each of 2 days.
