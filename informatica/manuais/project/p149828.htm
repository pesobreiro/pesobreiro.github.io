<H2>Create or Modify a View</H2>

<P>
Although Microsoft Project supplies a number of predefined views that are suitable for each phase of your 
project, you might find that none of them meets your need at a particular time. Perhaps you want a view that 
includes a special set of fields or unique formatting. Whatever your reason, you can create a view that satisfies 
your specific need.
<P>
If the view you want to create differs significantly from existing views, you can create a view from scratch. That 
doesn’t mean, however, that you can make a new view appear any way you want. When you create a view from 
scratch, you base the new view on the screen type of a Microsoft Project predefined view. A <I>screen 
type</I> is the look and format of a predefined view. For example, you can create a view that looks like the 
Gantt Chart view or the Resource Usage view.
<P>
If the view you want to create is similar to an existing view, you can modify a copy of that view, leaving the 
original unchanged. Copying an existing view is similar to creating a view from scratch, except that when you 
copy a view, you can’t choose the screen type. You can only use the screen type of the view you’re copying.
<P>
When you edit a view, you change the original view and not a copy of it. Before you edit a view, make sure 
that you’ll be satisfied with the changes. After you save those changes, you can’t automatically reset the view 
back to its original form. If you’re not sure you need to edit a view, copy it, and then modify the copy instead.
