<B>Lag time</B>
<P>
The amount of time delay between the&nbsp;completion of one task and the start of its successor task. For 
example, if you need a 2-day delay between the finish of one task and the start of another, you can establish a 
finish-to-start dependency and specify a 2-day lag time. You enter lag time as a positive value.
<P>
<B>Lead time</B>
<P>
An overlap between tasks that have a dependency. For example, if a task can start when its predecessor is half 
finished, you can specify a&nbsp;finish-to-start dependency with a lead time of 50&nbsp;percent for the 
successor task. You enter lead time as a negative value.
<P>
<B>Legend</B>
<P>
An explanatory list of symbols that is or can be on a printed chart or graph.
<P>
<B>Leveling</B>
<P>
Resolving resource conflicts or overallocations by either delaying certain tasks and assignments or by splitting 
tasks.
<P>
<B>Link</B>
<P>
A dependency between tasks that specifies when a task begins or ends relative to another task.
<P>
<B>Link line</B>
<P>
On the Gantt bar chart and the PERT chart, the line that appears between two tasks to indicate a task 
dependency.
<P>
<B>Linking</B>
<P>
In a project, establishing a dependency between tasks. When you link tasks, you define a&nbsp;dependency 
between their start and finish dates. There are four kinds of task dependencies: finish-to-start (FS), start-to-
start (SS), finish-to-finish (FF), and start-to-finish (SF).
<P>
In object linking and embedding (OLE), establishing a connection between programs, so&nbsp;that 
information such as a chart or text in a container document can be updated whenever that&nbsp;information 
changes in the source document. See <I>embedding</I>.
