<H3>Customize Workgroup Messages</H3>

<P>
Workgroup messages convey the task and assignment information that the project manager needs to monitor 
project progress and keep the project on track. The information needs may vary from project to project. For 
example, the Task Name, Work, Start, and Finish fields appear in the TeamAssign and TeamStatus workgroup 
messages by default. But what if it’s important in your project to know what portion of each task has been 
completed by a specific date?
<P>
You can customize workgroup messages to meet your needs. For example, you can include the % Complete 
field and other fields, remove fields you don’t need, change the report period, and track overtime work.
