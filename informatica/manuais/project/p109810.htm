<H2>Identify and Correct Obvious Errors</H2>

<P>
Everybody makes mistakes, so it’s no disgrace to find that you’ve made some when adding information to your 
project plan. But leaving them in will make your plan a less accurate and reliable tool for predicting and 
controlling the course of your project. It’s better to look for and correct those mistakes before your project is 
well under way. The following are some of the most common errors:
<UL>
<LI>You’ve added incorrect information about tasks and resources. For example, is a fixed cost, such as the 
cost of materials associated with a task, accurate? Did you inadvertently enter a 12-day duration for a task that 
takes only 2 days to complete?
<LI>A resource is assigned to the wrong task. Perhaps you’ve assigned a plumber to a roofing task.
<LI>Some information is inconsistent with other information. Did you intend to pay one of your 10 painters 
$20.00 per hour while paying the others $15.00 per hour?
<LI>Tasks are out of order. For example, the wall can’t be painted before it’s built.
<LI>Tasks or resources are missing. Between &quot;Raising the frame&quot; and &quot;Building the 
walls&quot; you might need to insert &quot;Adding the insulation.&quot;
</UL>
