<BR>&quot;Microsoft Project enabled us to structure a company-wide transition to a Microsoft Windows® 95 platform within a very limited time 
frame.&quot;
<P>
DHL Systems Inc. provides technology services and systems support for DHL Worldwide Express, which 
operates in more than 200 countries. This systems unit of the international air express services organization is 
based in Burlingame, CA.
<P>
The variety of computer platforms at DHL Systems created additional work for systems administrators. 
Hardware included a variety of UNIX-based workstations operating TCP/IP and Novell networks. Many of the 
organization’s 130 employees also used PCs that ran the Microsoft Windows 3.1 operating system and a 
number of applications.
<P>
A decision was made by an executive management committee to move the PCs to the Microsoft Windows 95 
operating system and to upgrade the applications.
<P>
Responsibility for developing a comprehensive solution for this transition was handed to Jim Miglino, Patrick 
Morrissey, and two other systems administrators. The executive committee wanted a complete plan from the 
administrators in just 30 days.
<P>
This presented the team with a tough challenge. They had to develop a complete solution outlining every 
procedure needed to implement the new computer system in six months. In addition to planning all details of 
the migration to the Microsoft Windows 95 platform, their regular duties still had to be fulfilled.
<P>
After examining several other project management programs, Patrick and his colleagues selected Microsoft 
Project as their planning tool because it was the easiest to learn and allowed them to fulfill all requirements 
within the time, cost, and resource constraints.
