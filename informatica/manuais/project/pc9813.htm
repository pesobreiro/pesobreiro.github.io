<H1>Customizing Windows or Windows  NT</H1>

<P>
There are many ways you can customize Windows or Windows  NT to make your computer more accessible. 
<UL>
<LI>Beginning with Windows  95, accessibility features are built in to Windows. These features are useful for 
individuals who have difficulty typing or using a  mouse, who have moderately impaired vision, or who are 
deaf or hard-of-hearing. The features can be installed during setup, or you can add them later from your 
Windows  95 installation disks. For information about installing and  using these features, see 
&quot;accessibility&quot; in the Windows Help Index.
<LI>Many of the features that make Windows  95 and Windows  NT  4.0 more accessible can be added to 
earlier versions of Windows  NT, Microsoft Windows, and MS-DOS® through Access Packs. You can 
download these files  by modem or order them on disks from Microsoft.
<LI>You can use the Control Panel and other built-in features to adjust the appearance and behavior of 
Windows or Windows  NT to suit varying vision and motor abilities. You can adjust colors and sizes, sound 
volume, and the behavior of the mouse and keyboard.
<LI>Dvorak keyboard layouts make the most frequently typed characters on a  keyboard more accessible if 
you have difficulty using the standard &quot;QWERTY&quot; layout. There are three Dvorak layouts: one if 
you’re a two-handed user, one if you type with your left hand only, and one if you type with  your right hand 
only. You do not need to purchase any special equipment  to use these features.
</UL>
<P>
The specific features available, and whether they are built in or must be obtained  separately, depend on which 
operating system you’re using. For full documentation on the accessibility features available in the operating 
system you’re using, obtain the appropriate application notes listed below. Accessibility features are also 
documented in the <I>Microsoft Windows  95 Resource Kit </I>and the  <I>Microsoft Windows  NT Resource 
Kit</I>.
