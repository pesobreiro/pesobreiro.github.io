This is a primer for producing documents in HTML, the hypertext markup language
used on the World Wide Web. This guide is intended to be an introduction
to using HTML and creating files for the Web. Links are provided to additional
information. You should also check your local bookstore; there are many
volumes about the Web and HTML that could be useful.

    <A NAME = "WT">What Isn't Covered</A></H4>
<P>
This primer assumes that you:

<UL>
<LI>know how to use <A HREF="/SDG/Software/Mosaic/">NCSA Mosaic</A> or
    some other Web browser
<LI>have a general understanding of how Web servers and client browsers
    work
<LI>have access to a Web server (or that you want to produce HTML documents 
    for personal use in local-viewing mode)
</UL>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME = "HV">HTML Version</A></H4>
</P><P>
This guide reflects the most current specification--HTML Version 4.0--
plus some additional features that have been widely and consistently
implemented in browsers. Future versions and new features for HTML
are under development.

</P><P>
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME = "WI">What an HTML Document Is</A></H4>
</P><P>

HTML documents are plain-text (also known as ASCII) files that can be
created using any text editor (e.g., Emacs or vi on UNIX machines;
SimpleText on a Macintosh; Notepad on a Windows machine). You can also use
word-processing software if you remember to save your document as "text
only with line breaks".

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME = "HE">HTML Editors</A></H4>
</P><P>

Some WYSIWYG editors are also available (e.g., Claris Home Page or Adobe
PageMill, both for Windows and Macintosh). You may wish to try one of
them after you learn some of the basics of HTML tagging. WYSIWYG is an
acronym for "what you see is what you get"; it means that you design
your HTML document visually, as if you were using a word processor,
instead of writing the markup tags in a plain-text file and imagining
what the resulting page will look like. It is useful to know enough HTML
to code a document before you determine the usefulness of a WYSIWYG
editor, in case you want to add HTML features that your editor doesn't support.
</P><P>
If you haven't already selected your software, refer to Tom Magliery's <A
HREF="http://sdg.ncsa.uiuc.edu/~mag/work/HTMLEditors/">online listing of
HTML editors</A> (organized by platform) to help you in your search for
appropriate software.

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME = "GY">Getting Your Files on a Server</A></H4>
</P><P>

If you have access to a Web server at school or work, contact your
<I>webmaster</I> (the individual who maintains the server) to see how
you can get your files on the Web. If you do not have access to a server
at work or school, check to see if your community operates a
<I>FreeNet</I>, a community-based network that provides free access to
the Internet. Lacking a FreeNet, you may need to contact a local
Internet provider that will post your files on a server for a fee.
(Check your local newspaper for advertisements or with your Chamber of
Commerce for the names of companies.)

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME = "TEM">Tags Explained</A></H4>
</P><P>

An <I>element</I> is a fundamental component of the structure of a text
document. Some examples of elements are heads, tables, paragraphs, and
lists. Think of it this way: you use HTML tags to mark the elements of a
file for your browser. Elements can contain plain text, other elements,
or both.
</P><P>
To denote the various elements in an HTML document, you use <I>tags</I>.
HTML tags consist of a left angle bracket (<TT>&lt;</TT>), a tag name,
and a right angle bracket (<TT>&gt;</TT>). Tags are usually paired
(e.g., <TT>&lt;H1&gt;</TT> and <TT>&lt;/H1&gt;</TT>) to start and end
the tag instruction. The end tag looks just like the start tag except a
slash (/) precedes the text within the brackets. HTML tags are <A
HREF="#MT">listed below</A>.
</P><P>
Some elements may include an <I>attribute</I>, which is additional
information that is included inside the start tag. For example, you can
specify the alignment of images (top, middle, or bottom) by including
the appropriate attribute with the image source HTML code. Tags that
have optional attributes are <A HREF="#MT">noted below</A>.
</P><P>
<B>NOTE:</B><I> HTML is not case sensitive.
</I><TT>&lt;title&gt;</TT> is equivalent to 
<TT>&lt;TITLE&gt;</TT> or <TT>&lt;TiTlE&gt;</TT>. There are a
few exceptions noted in <A HREF = "#ES">Escape Sequences</A> below.
</P><P>
Not all tags are supported by all World Wide Web browsers. If a browser
does not support a tag, it will simply ignore it. Any text placed
between a pair of unknown tags will still be displayed, however.




<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="TM2">The Minimal HTML Document</A></H4>
</P><P>
Every HTML document should contain certain standard HTML tags.  
Each document consists of head and body text. The head contains
the title, and the body contains the actual text that is made
up of paragraphs, lists, and other elements. Browsers expect
specific information because they are programmed according to HTML
and SGML specifications.
</P><P>
Required elements are shown in this sample bare-bones document:
</P><P>
<PRE>    &lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;TITLE&gt;A Simple HTML Example&lt;/TITLE&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;H1&gt;HTML is Easy To Learn&lt;/H1&gt;
    &lt;P&gt;Welcome to the world of HTML.
    This is the first paragraph. While short it is  
    still a paragraph!&lt;/P&gt;
    &lt;P&gt;And this is the second paragraph.&lt;/P&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
</PRE>

The required elements are the <TT>&lt;html&gt;</TT>,
<TT>&lt;head&gt;</TT>, <TT>&lt;title&gt;</TT>, and <TT>&lt;body&gt;</TT>
tags (and their corresponding end tags). Because you should include
these tags in each file, you might want to create a template file with
them. (Some browsers will format your HTML file correctly even if these
tags are not included. But some browsers won't! So make sure to include them.)
</P><P>
Click to see the <A HREF="simpleexample.html">formatted version</A>
of the example. A <A HREF="LongerCoded.html">longer example</A> is also 
available but you should read through the rest of the guide before
you take a look. This longer-example file contains tags explained
in the next section.
</P><P>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="TeT">A Teaching Tool</A></H4>
</P><P>
To see a copy of the file that your browser reads to generate the
information in your current window, select View Source (or the
equivalent) from the browser menu. (Most browsers have a "View" menu
under which this command is listed.) The file contents, with all the
HTML tags, are displayed in a new window.
</P><P>
This is an excellent way to see how HTML is used and to learn tips and
constructs. Of course, the HTML might not be technically correct. Once
you become familiar with HTML and check the many online and hard-copy
references on the subject, you will learn to distinguish between "good"
and "bad" HTML.
</P><P>
Remember that you can save a source file with the HTML codes and use it
as a template for one of your Web pages or modify the format to suit
your purposes.





</P><P> 
<H2>
    <A NAME="MT">Markup Tags</A></H2>
</P><P>
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="HT">HTML</A></H4>
</P><P>
This element tells your browser that the file contains HTML-coded
information. The file extension <TT>.html</TT> also indicates this an
HTML document and must be used. (If you are restricted to 8.3 filenames
(e.g., <TT>LeeHome.htm</TT>, use only <TT>.htm</TT> for your extension.)


<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="HE2">HEAD</A></H4>
</P><P>
The head element identifies the first part of your HTML-coded document
that contains the title. The title is shown as part of your browser's
window (see below).

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="TI">TITLE</A></H4>
</P><P>
The title element contains your document title and identifies its
content in a global context. The title is typically displayed in the title
bar at the top of the browser window, but not inside the window itself. The
title is also what is displayed on someone's hotlist or bookmark list,
so choose something descriptive, unique, and relatively short. A title
is also used to identify your page for search engines (such as <A
HREF="http://www.hotbot.com/">HotBot</A> or <A
HREF="http://www.infoseek.com/">Infoseek</A>).
</P><P>
For example, you might include a shortened title of a book along with
the chapter contents: <I>NCSA Mosaic Guide (Windows): Installation</I>.
This tells the software name, the platform, and the chapter contents,
which is more useful than simply calling the document
<I>Installation</I>. Generally you should keep your titles to 64
characters or fewer.


<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="BO">BODY</A></H4>
</P><P>
The second--and largest--part of your HTML document is the body, which
contains the content of your document (displayed within the text area of
your browser window). The tags explained below are used within the body
of your HTML document.


<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="HE3">Headings</A></H4>
</P><P>
HTML has six levels of headings, numbered 1 through 6, with 1 being
the largest. Headings are typically displayed in larger and/or bolder
fonts than normal body text. The first heading in each document should
be tagged <TT>&lt;H1&gt;</TT>.  
</P><P>
The syntax of the heading element is:
<BR>
<TT>&lt;H</TT><I>y</I><TT>&gt;</TT><I>Text of heading</I><TT>
&lt;/H</TT><I>y</I><TT>&gt;</TT>
<BR>
where <I>y</I> is a number between 1 and 6 specifying the level
of the heading. 
</P><P>
Do not skip levels of headings in your document. For example, don't
start with a level-one heading (&lt;H1&gt;) and then next use a
level-three (&lt;H3&gt;) heading.


<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="PA">Paragraphs</A></H4>
</P><P>
Unlike documents in most word processors, carriage returns in HTML files
aren't significant. In fact, any amount of <I>whitespace</I> --
including spaces, linefeeds, and carriage returns -- are automatically
compressed into a single space when your HTML document is displayed in a
browser. So you don't have to worry about how long your lines of text
are. Word wrapping can occur at any point in your source file without 
affecting how the page will be displayed.
</P><P>
In the bare-bones example shown in the Minimal HTML Document section,
the first paragraph is coded as 

<PRE>    &lt;P&gt;Welcome to the world of HTML.  
    This is the first paragraph.
    While short it is
    still a paragraph!&lt;/P&gt;
</PRE>

</P><P>
In the source file there is a line break between the sentences. A
Web browser ignores this line break and starts a new paragraph only
when it encounters another <TT>&lt;P&gt;</TT> tag.  

</P><P>
<B>Important:</B>   
You must indicate paragraphs with <TT>&lt;P&gt;</TT> elements. A browser
ignores any indentations or blank lines in the source text. Without
<TT>&lt;P&gt;</TT> elements, the document becomes one large paragraph. (One
exception is text tagged as "preformatted," which is explained below.)
For example, the following would produce identical output as the first  
bare-bones HTML example:

<PRE>    &lt;H1&gt;Level-one heading&lt;/H1&gt;
    &lt;P&gt;Welcome to the world of HTML. This is the  
    first paragraph. While short it is still a
    paragraph! &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;And this is the second paragraph.&lt;/P&gt;
</PRE>

To preserve readability in HTML files, put headings on separate lines,
use a blank line or two where it helps identify the start of a new
section, and separate paragraphs with blank lines (in addition to the
<TT>&lt;P&gt;</TT> tags). These extra spaces will help you when you edit
your files (but your browser will ignore the extra spaces because it has
its own set of rules on spacing that do not depend on the spaces you put
in your source file).

</P><P>
<B>NOTE:</B>
The <TT>&lt;/P&gt;</TT> closing tag may be omitted. This is because
browsers understand that when they encounter a <TT>&lt;P&gt;</TT> tag,
it means that the previous paragraph has ended. However, since HTML now
allows certain attributes to be assigned to the <TT>&lt;P&gt;</TT> tag,
it's generally a good idea to include it.

</P><P>
Using the <TT>&lt;P&gt;</TT> and <TT>&lt;/P&gt;</TT> as a paragraph
container means that you can center a paragraph by including the
<TT>ALIGN=</TT><I>alignment</I> attribute in your source file.

<PRE>    &lt;TT&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=CENTER&gt;&lt;/TT&gt;
    This is a centered paragraph.
    [See the formatted version below.]
    &lt;/P&gt;
</PRE>
</P><P>
</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>
This is a centered paragraph.
</P>
</P><P>
It is also possible to align a paragraph to the right instead, by
including the <TT>ALIGN=RIGHT</TT> attribute. <TT>ALIGN=LEFT</TT> is the
default alignment; if no <TT>ALIGN</TT> attribute is included, the
paragraph will be left-aligned.


<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="LI">Lists</A></H4>
</P><P>
HTML supports unnumbered, numbered, and definition lists. You can nest
lists too, but use this feature sparingly because too many nested items
can get difficult to follow.

</P><P><B>Unnumbered Lists</B>
</P><P>
To make an unnumbered, bulleted list,
<OL>
    <LI>start with an opening list <TT>&lt;UL&gt;</TT> (for unnumbered list) tag
    <LI>enter the <TT>&lt;LI&gt;</TT> (list item) tag followed by the
        individual item; no closing <TT>&lt;/LI&gt;</TT> tag is needed
    <LI>end the entire list with a closing list <TT>&lt;/UL&gt;</TT> tag
</OL>

</P><P>
Below is a sample three-item list:  

<PRE>    &lt;UL&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt; apples
    &lt;LI&gt; bananas
    &lt;LI&gt; grapefruit
    &lt;/UL&gt;
</PRE>

</P><P>
The output is:

<UL>
<LI>apples  
<LI>bananas 
<LI>grapefruit
</UL>

</P><P>
The <TT>&lt;LI&gt;</TT> items can contain multiple paragraphs.
Indicate the paragraphs with the <TT>&lt;P&gt;</TT> paragraph
tags.

</P><P>
<B>Numbered Lists</B>
</P><P>
A numbered list (also called an <I>ordered list</I>, from which the tag
name derives) is identical to an unnumbered list, except it uses
<TT>&lt;OL&gt;</TT> instead of <TT>&lt;UL&gt;</TT>. The items are tagged
using the same <TT>&lt;LI&gt;</TT> tag. The following HTML code:

<PRE>    &lt;OL&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt; oranges
    &lt;LI&gt; peaches
    &lt;LI&gt; grapes
    &lt;/OL&gt;
</PRE>

</P><P>
produces this formatted output:

<OL>
<LI>oranges 
<LI>peaches 
<LI>grapes  
</OL>

</P><P>
<B>Definition Lists</B>
</P><P>
A definition list (coded as <TT>&lt;DL&gt;</TT>) usually consists of
alternating a <I>definition term</I> (coded as <TT>&lt;DT&gt;</TT>) and
a definition definition (coded as <TT>&lt;DD&gt;</TT>). Web browsers
generally format the definition on a new line and indent it.

</P><P>
The following is an example of a definition list:

<PRE>    &lt;DL&gt;
    &lt;DT&gt; NCSA
    &lt;DD&gt; NCSA, the National Center for Supercomputing
      Applications, is located on the campus of the
      University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
    &lt;DT&gt; Cornell Theory Center
    &lt;DD&gt; CTC is located on the campus of Cornell
      University in Ithaca, New York.
    &lt;/DL&gt;
</PRE>

</P><P>
The output looks like:  

<DL>
<DT>NCSA
<DD>NCSA, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, is located
    on the campus of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
<DT>Cornell Theory Center
<DD>CTC is located on the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca, New
    York.
</DL>

</P><P>
The <TT>&lt;DT&gt;</TT> and <TT>&lt;DD&gt;</TT> entries can
contain multiple paragraphs (indicated by <TT>&lt;P&gt;</TT> paragraph
tags), lists, or other definition information.
</P><P>
The <TT>COMPACT</TT> attribute can be used routinely in case your
definition terms are very short. If, for example, you are showing some
computer options, the options may fit on the same line as the start of
the definition.

<PRE>&lt;DL COMPACT&gt;
&lt;DT&gt; -i
&lt;DD&gt;invokes NCSA Mosaic for Microsoft Windows
  using the initialization file defined in the path
&lt;DT&gt; -k
&lt;DD&gt;invokes NCSA Mosaic for Microsoft Windows in
  kiosk mode
&lt;/DL&gt;
</PRE>

The output looks like:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>-i
<DD>invokes NCSA Mosaic for Microsoft Windows using the 
initialization file defined in the path.
<DT>-k
<DD>invokes NCSA Mosaic for Microsoft Windows in kiosk mode.
</DL>

</P><P>
<B>Nested Lists</B>
</P><P>
Lists can be nested. You can also have a number
of paragraphs, each containing a nested list, in a single list item.

</P><P>
Here is a sample nested list:

<PRE>    &lt;UL&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt; A few New England states:
        &lt;UL&gt;
        &lt;LI&gt; Vermont
        &lt;LI&gt; New Hampshire
        &lt;LI&gt; Maine

Use the<TT>&lt;PRE&gt;</TT> tag (which stands for "preformatted") to
generate text in a fixed-width font. This tag also makes spaces, new
lines, and tabs significant -- multiple spaces are displayed as multiple
spaces, and lines break in the same locations as in the source HTML
file. This is useful for program listings, among other things. For
example, the following lines:

<PRE>    &lt;PRE&gt;
      #!/bin/csh
      cd $SCR
      cfs get mysrc.f:mycfsdir/mysrc.f

</PRE>

</P><P>
The <TT>&lt;PRE&gt;</TT> tag can be used with an optional <TT>WIDTH</TT>
attribute that specifies the maximum number of characters for a line.
<TT>WIDTH</TT> also signals your browser to choose an appropriate font
and indentation for the text.
</P><P>
Hyperlinks can be used within <TT>&lt;PRE&gt;</TT> sections. You should
avoid using other HTML tags within <TT>&lt;PRE&gt;</TT> sections,
however.

</P><P>
Note that because &lt;, &gt;, and &amp; have special meanings in HTML,
you must use their escape sequences (<TT>&amp;lt;</TT>,
<TT>&amp;gt;</TT>, and <TT>&amp;amp;</TT>, respectively) to enter these
characters. See the section <A HREF = "#ES">Escape Sequences</A> for
more information.

    <A NAME="EQ">Extended Quotations</A></H4>
</P><P>
Use the <TT>&lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;</TT> tag to include lengthy quotations in
a separate block on the screen. Most browsers generally change the
margins for the quotation to separate it from surrounding text.

</P><P>
In the example:

<PRE>    &lt;P&gt;Omit needless words.&lt;/P&gt;
    &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
    &lt;P&gt;Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should

The <TT>&lt;BR&gt;</TT> tag forces a line break with no extra (white)
space between lines. Using <TT>&lt;P&gt;</TT> elements for short lines
of text such as postal addresses results in unwanted additional white
space. For example, with <BR>:
<PRE>    National Center for Supercomputing Applications&lt;BR&gt;

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="HR">Horizontal Rules</A></H4>
</P><P>
The <TT>&lt;HR&gt;</TT> tag produces a horizontal line the width
of the browser window. A horizontal rule is useful to separate
major sections of your document.
</P><P>
You can vary a rule's size (thickness) and width (the percentage of the
window covered by the rule). Experiment with the settings until you are
satisfied with the presentation. For example:
<PRE>&lt;HR SIZE=4 WIDTH="50%"&gt;
</PRE>

displays as: <HR SIZE=4 WIDTH=50%>



</P><P> 
<H2>
    <A NAME="CF">Character Formatting</A></H2>
</P><P>
HTML has two types of styles for individual words or sentences: logical
and physical. <EM>Logical styles</EM> tag text according to its meaning,
while <I>physical styles</I> indicate the specific appearance of a
section. For example, in the preceding sentence, the words "logical
styles" was tagged as "emphasis." The same effect (formatting those
words in italics) could have been achieved via a different tag that
tells your browser to "put these words in italics."
</P><P>
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="PV">Logical Versus Physical Styles</A></H4>
</P><P>
</P><P>
If physical and logical styles produce the same result on the screen,
why are there both? 
</P><P>
In the ideal SGML universe, content is divorced from presentation. Thus
SGML tags a level-one heading as a level-one heading, but does not
specify that the level-one heading should be, for instance, 24-point
bold Times centered. The advantage of this approach (it's similar in
concept to style sheets in many word processors) is that if you decide
to change level-one headings to be 20-point left-justified Helvetica,
all you have to do is change the definition of the level-one heading in
your Web browser. Indeed, many browsers today let you define how you want
the various HTML tags rendered on-screen using what are called
<I>cascading style sheets</I>, or CSS. CSS is more advanced than HTML,
though, and will not be covered in this Primer. (You can learn more
about CSS at the <A HREF="http://www.w3c.org/Style/">World Wide Web
Consortium</A> CSS site.) 
</P><P>
Another advantage of logical tags is that they help enforce consistency
in your documents. It's easier to tag something as <TT>&lt;H1&gt;</TT>
than to remember that level-one headings are 24-point bold Times
centered or whatever. For example, consider the <TT>&lt;STRONG&gt;</TT>
tag. Most browsers render it in bold text. However, it is possible that
a reader would prefer that these sections be displayed in red instead.
(This is possible using a local cascading style sheet on the reader's own
computer.) Logical styles offer this flexibility.

</P><P>
Of course, if you want something to be displayed in italics (for
example) and do not want a browser's setting to display it
differently, you should use physical styles. Physical styles, therefore,
offer consistency in that something you tag a certain way will always be
displayed that way for readers of your document.
</P><P>
Try to be consistent about which type of style you use. If you tag with
physical styles, do so throughout a document. If you use logical styles,
stick with them within a document. Keep in mind that future releases of
HTML might not support certain logical styles, which could mean that
browsers will not display your logical-style coding. (For example, the
<TT>&lt;DFN&gt;</TT> tag -- short for "definition", and typically
displayed in italics -- is not widely supported and will be ignored
if the reader's browser does not understand it.)

    <A NAME="ES">Escape Sequences</A> (a.k.a. Character Entities)</H4>
</P><P>
Character entities have two functions:

<UL>
<LI>escaping special characters
<LI>displaying other characters not available in the plain ASCII
    character set (primarily characters with diacritical marks)
</UL>

Three ASCII characters--the left angle bracket (&lt;), the right angle
bracket (&gt;), and the ampersand (&amp;)--have special meanings in HTML
and therefore cannot be used "as is" in text. (The angle brackets are
used to indicate the beginning and end of HTML tags, and the ampersand
is used to indicate the beginning of an escape sequence.) Double quote
marks may be used as-is but a character entity may also be used
(&quot;).
</P><P>
To use one of the three characters in an HTML document, you must enter
its <I>escape sequence</I> instead:

<DL>
<DT><TT>&amp;lt;</TT>
    <DD>the escape sequence for &lt;
<DT><TT>&amp;gt;</TT>
    <DD>the escape sequence for &gt;
<DT><TT>&amp;amp;</TT>
    <DD>the escape sequence for &amp;
</DL>

</P><P>
Additional escape sequences support accented characters, such as:

<DL>
<DT><TT>&amp;ouml;</TT>
    <DD>a lowercase o with an umlaut: &ouml;    
<DT><TT>&amp;ntilde;</TT>
    <DD>a lowercase n with a tilde: &ntilde;
<DT><TT>&amp;Egrave;</TT>
    <DD>an uppercase E with a grave accent: &Egrave;

You can substitute other letters for the <I>o</I>, <I>n</I>, and
<I>E</I> shown above. Visit the World Wide Web Consortium for a complete list of

<TT>&amp;lt;</TT>.

<H2>
    <A NAME="LI2">Linking</A></H2>
</P><P>
The chief power of HTML comes from its ability to link text and/or an
image to another document or section of a document. A browser highlights
the identified text or image with color and/or underlines to indicate
that it is a <I>hypertext link</I> (often shortened to <I>hyperlink</I>
or just <I>link</I>).

</P><P>
HTML's single hypertext-related tag is <TT>&lt;A&gt;</TT>, which
stands for <I>anchor</I>. To include an anchor in your document:

<OL>
<LI>start the anchor with <TT>&lt;A</TT>  (include a space after
    the <TT>A</TT>)
<LI>specify the document you're linking to by entering the parameter
    <TT>HREF="</TT><I>filename</I><TT>"</TT>
    followed by a closing right angle bracket (<TT>&gt;</TT>)
<LI>enter the text that will serve as the hypertext link in the current
    document
<LI>enter the ending anchor tag: <TT>&lt;/A&gt;</TT> (no space
    is needed before the end anchor tag)
</OL>

</P><P>
Here is a sample hypertext reference in a file called <TT>US.html</TT>: 

<PRE>    &lt;A HREF="MaineStats.html"&gt;Maine&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>

</P><P>
This entry makes the word <I>Maine</I> the hyperlink to the document
<TT>MaineStats.html</TT>, which is in the same directory as the first
document.

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="RL">Relative Pathnames Versus Absolute Pathnames</A></H4>
</P><P>
You can link to documents in other directories by specifying the
<I>relative path</I> from the current document to the linked document.
For example, a link to a file <TT>NYStats.html</TT> located in the
subdirectory <TT>AtlanticStates</TT> would be:

<PRE>    &lt;A HREF="AtlanticStates/NYStats.html"&gt;New York&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>

</P><P>
These are called <I>relative links</I> because you are specifying the
path to the linked file relative to the location of the current file.
You can also use the absolute pathname (the complete URL) of the file,
but relative links are more efficient in accessing a server. They also
have the advantage of making your documents more "portable" -- for
instance, you can create several web pages in a single folder on your
local computer, using relative links to hyperlink one page to another,
and then upload the entire folder of web pages to your web server. The
pages on the server will then link to other pages on the server, and the
copies on your hard drive will still point to the other pages stored there.
</P><P>
It is important to point out that UNIX is a case-sensitive operating
system where filenames are concerned, while DOS and the MacOS are not.
For instance, on a Macintosh, "DOCUMENT.HTML", "Document.HTML", and
"document.html" are all the same name. If you make a relative hyperlink
to "DOCUMENT.HTML", and the file is actually named "document.html", the
link will still be valid. But if you upload all your pages to a UNIX web
server, the link will no longer work. Be sure to check your filenames
before uploading.
</P><P>
Pathnames use the standard UNIX syntax. The UNIX syntax for the parent
directory (the directory that contains the current directory) is "..". 
(For more information consult a beginning UNIX reference text such as
<I>Learning the UNIX Operating System</I> from O'Reilly and Associates,
Inc.)
</P><P>
If you were in the <TT>NYStats.html</TT> file and were referring to the original
document <TT>US.html</TT>, your link would look like this:

<PRE>    &lt;A HREF="../US.html"&gt;United States&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>


In general, you should use relative links whenever possible because:

<OL>
<LI>it's easier to move a group of documents to another location (because
    the relative path names will still be valid)
<LI>it's more efficient connecting to the server
<LI>there is less to type
</OL>

</P><P>
However, use absolute pathnames when linking to documents that are not
directly related. For example, consider a group of documents that
comprise a user manual. Links within this group should be relative
links. Links to other documents (perhaps a reference to related
software) should use absolute pathnames instead. This way if you move
the user manual to a different directory, none of the links would have
to be updated.




<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="UR">URLs</A></H4>
</P><P>
The World Wide Web uses Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) to specify
the location of files on other servers. A URL includes the type of
resource being accessed (e.g., Web, gopher, FTP), the address of the server,
and the location of the file. The syntax is:

</P><P>
<I>scheme</I><TT>://</TT><I>host.domain</I>
<TT>[:</TT><I>port</I><TT>]/</TT><I>path</I><TT>/</TT>

where <I>scheme</I> is one of

<DL>
<DT><TT>file</TT>
    <DD>a file on your local system
<DT><TT>ftp</TT>
    <DD>a file on an anonymous FTP server
<DT><TT>http</TT>
    <DD>a file on a World Wide Web server
<DT><TT>gopher</TT>

<DT><TT>news</TT>
    <DD>a Usenet newsgroup
<DT><TT>telnet</TT>
    <DD>a connection to a Telnet-based service
</DL>

The <I>port</I> number can generally be omitted. (That means unless
someone tells you otherwise, leave it out.)

</P><P>
There is also a <TT>mailto</TT> scheme, used to hyperlink email

    <A NAME="LTS">Links to Specific Sections</A></H4>
</P><P>
Anchors can also be used to move a reader to a <I>particular section</I>
in a document (either the same or a different document) rather than to
the top, which is the default. This type of an anchor is commonly called
a <I>named anchor</I> because to create the links, you insert HTML names
within the document.
</P><P>
This guide is a good example of using named anchors in one document. The
guide is constructed as one document to make printing easier. But as one
(long) document, it can be time-consuming to move through when all you
really want to know about is one bit of information about HTML. Internal
hyperlinks are used to create a "table of contents" at the top of this
document. These hyperlinks move you from one location in the document to
another location in the same document. (Go to the <A HREF="#top">top</A>
of this document and then click on the <I> Links to Specific
Sections</I> hyperlink in the table of contents. You will wind up back
here.)
</P><P> 
You can also link to a specific section in another document. That information is
presented first because understanding that helps you understand linking within one  
document.

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    Links Between Sections of Different Documents</H4>
</P><P>
Suppose you want to set a link from document A (<TT>documentA.html</TT>)
to a specific section in another document (<TT>MaineStats.html</TT>).
</P><P>
Enter the HTML coding for a link to a named anchor:
<PRE>     <TT>documentA.html</TT>:
    
     In addition to the many state parks, Maine is also home to 
     &lt;a href="MaineStats.html#ANP"&gt;Acadia National Park&lt;/a&gt;.
</PRE>

Think of the characters after the hash (#) mark as a tab within the
<TT>MaineStats.html</TT> file. This tab tells your browser what should
be displayed at the top of the window when the link is activated. In
other words, the first line in your browser window should be the Acadia
National Park heading.
</P><P>
Next, create the <I>named anchor</I> (in this example "ANP") in
<TT>MaineStats.html</TT>:

<PRE>  &lt;H2&gt;&lt;A NAME="ANP"&gt;Acadia National Park&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/H2&gt;
 </PRE>
With both of these elements in place, you can bring a reader directly to
the Acadia reference in <TT>MaineStats.html</TT>.
</P><P>
<B>NOTE:</B> You cannot make links to specific sections within a
different document unless either you have write permission to the coded
source of that document or that document already contains in-document
named anchors. For example, you could include named anchors to this
primer in a document you are writing because there are named anchors in
this guide (use View Source in your browser to see the coding). But if
this document did <I>not</I> have named anchors, you could not make a
link to a specific section because you cannot edit the original file on
NCSA's server.


<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    Links to Specific Sections within the Current Document</H4>
</P><P>
The technique is the same except the filename is <I>omitted</I>.    

</P><P>
For example, to link to the <TT>ANP</TT> anchor from
within <TT>MaineStats</TT>, enter:

<PRE>  ...More information about
  &lt;A HREF="#ANP"&gt;Acadia National Park&lt;/a&gt;
  is available elsewhere in this document.
    </PRE>

Be sure to include the <TT>&lt;A NAME=&gt;</TT> tag at the place in your
document where you want the link to jump to (<TT>&lt;A
NAME="ANP"&gt;Acadia National Park&lt;/a&gt;</TT>).
</P><P>
Named anchors are particularly useful when you think readers will print
a document in its entirety or when you have a lot of short information
you want to place online in one file.


<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="M2">Mailto</A></H4>
</P><P>
</P><P>
You can make it easy for a reader to send electronic mail to a specific
person or mail alias by including the <TT>mailto</TT> attribute in a hyperlink.
The format is:
<PRE>&lt;A HREF="mailto:<I>emailinfo@host</I>"&gt;<I>Name</I>&lt;/a&gt;
</PRE>

For example, enter:
<PRE> &lt;A HREF="mailto:<I>pubs@ncsa.uiuc.edu</I>"&gt;
 <I>NCSA Publications Group</I>&lt;/a&gt;
</PRE>

to create a mail window that is already configured to open a mail window for the
<A HREF="mailto:pubs@ncsa.uiuc.edu">NCSA Publications
Group</A> alias. (You, of course, will enter another mail address!)



</P><P> 
<H2>
    <A NAME="II">Inline Images</A></H2>
</P><P>
Most Web browsers can display inline images (that is, images next to
text) that are in X Bitmap (XBM), GIF, or JPEG format. Other image
formats are also being incorporated into Web browsers [e.g., the
Portable Network Graphic (PNG) format]. Each image takes additional time
to download and slows down the initial display of a document. Carefully
select your images and the number of images in a document.
</P><P>
To include an inline image, enter:

<PRE>    &lt;IMG SRC=<I>ImageName</I>&gt;
</PRE>

</P><P>
where <I>ImageName</I> is the URL of the image file.
</P><P>
The syntax for <TT>&lt;IMG SRC&gt;</TT> URLs is identical to that used
in an anchor <TT>HREF</TT>. If the image file is a GIF file, then the
filename part of <I>ImageName</I> must  end with <TT>.gif</TT>.
Filenames of X Bitmap images must end with <TT>.xbm</TT>; JPEG image
files must end with <TT>.jpg</TT> or <TT>.jpeg</TT>; and Portable
Network Graphic files must end with <TT>.png</TT>.


<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="IS">Image Size Attributes</A></H4>
</P><P>
You should include two other attributes on <TT>&lt;IMG&gt;</TT> tags to
tell your browser the size of the images it is downloading with the
text. The <TT>HEIGHT</TT> and <TT>WIDTH</TT> attributes let your browser
set aside the appropriate space (in pixels) for the images as it
downloads the rest of the file. (You can get the pixel size from your
image-processing software, such as Adobe Photoshop. Some browsers
will also display the dimensions of an image file in the title bar
if the image is viewed by itself without an enclosing HTML document.)
</P><P>
For example, to include a self portrait image in a file along with the  
portrait's dimensions, enter:

<PRE>    &lt;IMG SRC=SelfPortrait.gif HEIGHT=100 WIDTH=65&gt;
</PRE>
</P><P>
<B>NOTE:</B> Some browsers use the <TT>HEIGHT</TT> and <TT>WIDTH</TT>
attributes to stretch or shrink an image to fit into the allotted space
when the image does not exactly match the attribute numbers. Not all
browser developers think stretching/shrinking is a good idea, so don't
plan on your readers having access to this feature. Check your
dimensions and use the correct ones.



<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="AI">Aligning Images</A></H4>
</P><P>
You have some flexibility when displaying images. You can have images
separated from text and aligned to the left or right or centered. Or you
can have an image aligned with text. Try several possibilities to see
how your information looks best.
</P><P>
<B>Aligning Text with an Image</B><BR>
<IMG SRC = "BarHotlist.gif" ALT = "[HOTLIST]">
By default the bottom of an image is aligned with the following text, as
shown in this paragraph. You can align images to the top or center of a
paragraph using the <TT>ALIGN=</TT> attributes <TT>TOP</TT> and
<TT>CENTER</TT>.
</P><P>
<IMG SRC = "BarHotlist.gif" ALT="[HOTLIST]" ALIGN=TOP> This text is
aligned with
the top of the image (<TT>&lt;IMG SRC = "BarHotlist.gif" ALT="[HOTLIST]"
ALIGN=TOP&gt;</TT>). Notice how the browser aligns only one line and
then jumps to the bottom of the image for the rest of the text.
</P><P>
<IMG SRC = "BarHotlist.gif" ALT = "[HOTLIST]" ALIGN=CENTER> And this text is
centered on the image (<TT>&lt;IMG SRC = "BarHotlist.gif" ALT="[HOTLIST]"
ALIGN=CENTER&gt;</TT>). Again, only one line of text is centered; the
rest is below the image.
</P><P>

</P><P>
<B>Images without Text</B>
<BR>
To display an image without any associated text (e.g., your
organization's logo), make it a separate paragraph. Use the paragraph
<TT>ALIGN=</TT> attribute to center the image or adjust it to the right
side of the window as shown below:

<PRE>&lt;p ALIGN=CENTER&gt;
&lt;IMG SRC = "BarHotlist.gif" ALT="[HOTLIST]"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
</PRE>

which results in:

</P><P ALIGN=CENTER>
<IMG SRC="BarHotlist.gif" ALT = "[HOTLIST]">
</P>

The image is centered; this paragraph starts below it and left justified.
</P><P>




<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="AT2">Alternate Text for Images</A></H4>
</P><P>
</P><P>
Some World Wide Web browsers -- primarily the text-only browsers such as
<A HREF="http://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx</A> -- cannot display images. Some
users turn off image loading even if their software can display images
(especially if they are using a modem or have a slow connection). HTML
provides a mechanism to tell readers what they are missing on your
pages if they can't load images. </P><P> The <TT>ALT</TT> attribute lets you
specify text to be displayed instead of an image. For example:

<PRE>    &lt;IMG SRC="UpArrow.gif" ALT="Up"&gt;
</PRE>

</P><P>
where <TT>UpArrow.gif </TT>is the picture of an upward pointing arrow.
With graphics-capable viewers that have image-loading turned on, you see
the up arrow graphic. With a text-only browser or if image-loading is turned
off, the word <I>Up</I> is shown in your window in place of the image.
</P><P>
You should try to include alternate text for each image you use in your
document, which is a courtesy for your readers -- or, for users who
might be visually impaired, a necessity.





<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="IH">Images as Hyperlinks</A></H4>
</P><P>
Inline images can be used as hyperlinks just like plain text. 
The following HTML code:

<PRE>    &lt;A HREF="hotlist.html"&gt;&lt;IMG SRC="BarHotlist.gif" ALT="[HOTLIST]"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>

</P><P>
Produces the following result:

</P><P>
    <A HREF="hotlist.html"><IMG
        SRC="BarHotlist.gif" ALT="[HOTLIST]"></A>

</P><P>
(Note that this link doesn't actually go anywhere.)
The blue border that surrounds the image indicates that it's a clickable 
hyperlink. You may not always want this border to be displayed, though.
In this case you can use the BORDER attribute of the IMG tag to make the
image appear as normal. Adding the BORDER attribute and setting it to zero:

<PRE>    &lt;A HREF="hotlist.html"&gt;&lt;IMG SRC="BarHotlist.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="[HOTLIST]"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>

</P><P>
Produces the following result:
</P><P>
    <A HREF="hotlist.html"><IMG
        SRC="BarHotlist.gif" BORDER=0 ALT="[HOTLIST]"></A>

</P><P>
The BORDER attribute can also be set to non-zero values, whether or
not the image is used as a hyperlink. In this case, the border will appear
using the default text color for the web page.
For instance, if you wanted to give your image a plain black border to help
it stand out on the page, you might try this:

<PRE>    &lt;IMG SRC="BarHotlist.gif" BORDER=6 ALT="[HOTLIST]"&gt;
</PRE>

</P><P>
And get the following result:
</P><P>
    <IMG SRC="BarHotlist.gif" BORDER=6 ALT="[HOTLIST]">





<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="BG">Background Graphics</A></H4>
</P><P>
Newer versions of Web browsers can load an image and use it as a
background when displaying a page. Some people like background images
and some don't. In general, if you want to include a background, make
sure your text can be read easily when displayed on top of the image.
</P><P>
Background images can be a texture (linen finished paper, for example)
or an image of an object (a logo possibly). You create the background
image as you do any image.
</P><P>
However you only have to create a small piece of the image. Using a
feature called tiling, a browser takes the image and repeats it across
and down to fill your browser window. In sum you generate one image, and
the browser replicates it enough times to fill your window. This action
is automatic when you use the background tag shown below.
</P><P>
The tag to include a background image is included in the
<TT>&lt;BODY&gt;</TT> statement as an attribute:

<PRE>&lt;BODY BACKGROUND="<I>filename</I>.gif"&gt;
</PRE>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="OC">Background Color</A></H4>
</P><P>
By default browsers display text in black on a gray background. However,
you can change both elements if you want. Some HTML authors select a
background color and coordinate it with a change in the color of the
text.
</P><P>
Always preview changes like this to make sure your pages are readable.
(For example, many people find red text on a black background difficult
to read!) In general, try to avoid using high-contrast images or images
that use the color of your text anywhere within the graphic.
</P><P>
You change the color of text, links, visited links, and active links (links 
that are currently being clicked on) using further attributes of the
<TT>&lt;BODY&gt;</TT> tag. For example:

<PRE>&lt;BODY BGCOLOR="#000000" TEXT="#FFFFFF" LINK="#9690CC"&gt;
</PRE>
This creates a window with a black background (<TT>BGCOLOR</TT>), white text
(<TT>TEXT</TT>), and silvery hyperlinks (<TT>LINK</TT>).
</P><P> 
The six-digit number and letter combinations represent colors by giving
their RGB (red, green, blue) value. The six digits are actually three
two-digit numbers in sequence, representing the amount of red, green, or
blue as a hexadecimal value in the range 00-FF. For example, 000000 is
black (no color at all), FF0000 is bright red, 0000FF is bright blue,
and FFFFFF is white (fully saturated with all three colors).
</P><P>
These number and letter combinations are generally rather cryptic.
Fortunately an online resource is available to help you track down the
combinations that map to specific colors and there is software available
for you to do this on your workstation:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.hidaho.com/colorcenter/">hIdaho ColorCenter</A><BR>
</UL>

</P><P> 
For some basic colors -- typically those in the standard
sixteen-color Windows 3.1 palette -- you can also use the name of the
color instead of the corresponding RGB value. For example, "black",
"red", "blue", and "cyan" are all valid for use in place of RGB values.
However, while not all browsers will understand all color names, any
browser that can display colors will understand RGB values, so use
them whenever possible.


<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="EI">External Images, Sounds, and Animations</A></H4>
</P><P>
You may want to have an image open as a separate document when a user
activates a link on either a word or a smaller, inline version of
the image included in your document. This is called an external
image, and it is useful if you do not wish to slow down the loading of
the main document with large inline images.

</P><P>
To include a reference to an external image, enter: 

<PRE>    &lt;A HREF="<I>MyImage.gif</I>"&gt;link anchor&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>

You can also use a smaller image as a link to a larger image. Enter:

<PRE>     &lt;A HREF="<I>LargerImage.gif</I>"&gt;&lt;IMG SRC="<I>SmallImage.gif</I>"&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>

The reader sees the <TT>SmallImage.gif</TT> image and clicks on it to
open the <TT>LargerImage.gif</TT> file.
</P><P>
Use the same syntax for links to external animations and sounds.
The only difference is the file extension of the linked file. For example,

</P><P>
<TT>&lt;A HREF="AdamsRib.mov"&gt;link anchor&lt;/A&gt;</TT>

</P><P>
specifies a link to a QuickTime movie. Some common file types and their
extensions are:
</P><P>
<DL>
<DT>plain text
    <DD><TT>.txt</TT>
<DT>HTML document
    <DD><TT>.html</TT>
<DT>GIF image
    <DD><TT>.gif</TT>
<DT>TIFF image
    <DD><TT>.tiff</TT>
<DT>X Bitmap image
    <DD><TT>.xbm</TT>
<DT>JPEG image
    <DD><TT>.jpg</TT> or <TT>.jpeg</TT>
<DT>PostScript file
    <DD><TT>.ps</TT>
<DT>AIFF sound file
    <DD><TT>.aiff</TT>
<DT>AU sound file
    <DD><TT>.au</TT>
<DT>WAV sound file
    <DD><TT>.wav</TT>
<DT>QuickTime movie
    <DD><TT>.mov</TT>
<DT>MPEG movie
    <DD><TT>.mpeg</TT> or <TT>.mpg</TT>
</DL>

</P><P>
Keep in mind your intended audience and their access to software. Most UNIX
workstations, for instance, cannot view QuickTime movies.

    <A NAME="TA">Tables</A></H2>
</P><P>
Before HTML tags for tables were finalized, authors had to carefully
format their tabular information within <TT>&lt;PRE&gt;</TT> tags,
counting spaces and previewing their output. Tables are very useful for
presentation of tabular information as well as a boon to creative HTML
authors who use the table tags to present their regular Web pages.
(Check out the <A HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">NCSA home page</A> for an excellent example of using tables to control page layout.)
</P><P>
Think of your tabular information in light of the coding explained
below. A table has heads where you explain what the columns/rows
include, rows for information, cells for each item. In the following
table, the first column contains the header information, each row
explains an HTML table tag, and each cell contains a paired tag or an
explanation of the tag's function.

&lt;CAPTION&gt; caption contents &lt;/CAPTION&gt;   
<I>&lt;!-- caption definition --&gt;</I>

</P><P>
You can cut-and-paste the above code into your own HTML documents, adding
new rows or cells as necessary. The above example looks like
<A HREF="GenTableFormat.html">this</A> when rendered in a browser.

</P><P>
The <TT>&lt;TABLE&gt;</TT> and <TT>&lt;/TABLE&gt;</TT> tags <B>must</B>
surround the entire table definition.  The first item inside the table
is the <TT>CAPTION</TT>, which is optional. Then you can have any number
of rows defined by the <TT>&lt;TR&gt;</TT> and <TT>&lt;/TR&gt;</TT>
tags. Within a row you can have any number of cells defined by the
<TT>&lt;TD&gt;</TT>...<TT>&lt;/TD&gt;</TT> or
<TT>&lt;TH&gt;</TT>...<TT>&lt;/TH&gt;</TT> tags. Each row of a table is,
essentially, formatted independently of the rows above and below it.
This lets you easily display tables like the one above with a single
cell, such as Table Attributes, spanning columns of the table.



<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="TF">Tables for Nontabular Information</A></H4>
</P><P>
Some HTML authors use tables to present nontabular information. For
example, because links can be included in table cells, some authors use
a table with no borders to create "one" image from separate images.
Browsers that can display tables properly show the various images
seamlessly, making the created image seem like an <I>image map</I> (one
image with hyperlinked quadrants).
</P><P>
Using table borders with images can create an impressive display as
well. Experiment and see what you like.




</P><P> 
<H2>
    <A NAME="FF">Fill-out Forms</A></H2>
</P><P>
Web forms let a reader return information to a Web server for some
action. For example, suppose you collect names and email addresses so
you can email some information to people who request it. For each person
who enters his or her name and address, you need some information to be
sent and the respondent's particulars added to a data base.
</P><P>
This processing of incoming data is usually handled by a script or
program written in Perl or another language that manipulates text,
files, and information. If you cannot write a program or script for your
incoming information, you need to find someone who can do this for you.
</P><P>
The forms themselves are not hard to code. They follow the same
constructs as other HTML tags. What could be difficult is the program or
script that takes the information submitted in a form and processes it.
Because of the need for specialized scripts to handle the incoming form
information, <A
HREF="/SDG/Software/Mosaic/Docs/fill-out-forms/overview.html">fill-out
forms</A> are not discussed in this primer. Check the <A

</P><P>
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="AO">Avoid Overlapping Tags</A></H4>
</P><P>
</P><P>
Consider this example of HTML:

<PRE>    &lt;B&gt;This is an example of &lt;I&gt;overlapping&lt;/B&gt;
    HTML tags.&lt;/I&gt;
</PRE>

</P><P>
The word <I>overlapping</I> is contained within both the
<TT>&lt;B&gt;</TT> and <TT>&lt;I&gt;</TT> tags. A browser might be
confused by this coding and might not display it the way you intend. The
only way to know is to check each popular browser (which is
time-consuming and impractical).
</P><P>
In general, avoid overlapping tags. Look at your tags and try pairing
them up. Tags (with the obvious exceptions of elements whose end tags
may be omitted, such as paragraphs) should be paired without an
intervening tag in between. Look again at the example above. You cannot
pair the bold tags without another tag in the middle (the first
definition tag). Try matching your coding up like this to see if you
have any problem areas that should be fixed before you release your
files to a server.

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    <A NAME="OE">Embed Only Anchors and Character Tags</A></H4>
</P><P>
HTML protocol allows you to embed links within other HTML tags:

<PRE>    &lt;H1&gt;&lt;A HREF="Destination.html"&gt;My heading&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/H1&gt;
</PRE>

</P><P>
<EM>Do not</EM> embed HTML tags within an anchor:

<PRE>    &lt;A HREF="Destination.html"&gt;
    &lt;H1&gt;My heading&lt;/H1&gt;
    &lt;/A&gt;
</PRE>

</P><P>
Although most browsers currently handle this second example, the
official HTML specifications do not support this construct and your file
will probably not work with future browsers. Remember that browsers can
be forgiving when displaying improperly coded files. But that
forgiveness may not last to the next version of the software! When in
doubt, code your files according to the HTML specifications (see <A
HREF="#FM">For More Information</A> below).

</P><P>
Character tags modify the appearance of the text within other elements:

<PRE>    &lt;UL&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;A bold list item&lt;/B&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt;&lt;I&gt;An italic list item&lt;/I&gt;
    &lt;/UL&gt;
</PRE>

</P><P>
Avoid embedding other types of HTML element tags. For example, you might
be tempted to embed a heading within a list in order to make the font
size larger:

<PRE>    &lt;UL&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt;&lt;H1&gt;A large heading&lt;/H1&gt;
    &lt;LI&gt;&lt;H2&gt;Something slightly smaller&lt;/H2&gt;
    &lt;/UL&gt;
</PRE>


</P><P>
Although some browsers handle this quite nicely, formatting of such
coding is unpredictable (because it is undefined). For compatibility
with all browsers, avoid these kinds of constructs. (The Netscape
&lt;FONT&gt; tag, which lets you specify how large individual characters
will be displayed in your window, is not currently part of the official
HTML specifications.)

</P><P>
What's the difference between embedding a <TT>&lt;B&gt;</TT> within a
<TT>&lt;LI&gt;</TT> tag as opposed to embedding a <TT>&lt;H1&gt;</TT>
within a <TT>&lt;LI&gt;</TT>? Within HTML the semantic meaning of
<TT>&lt;H1&gt;</TT> is that it's the main heading of a document and that
it should be followed by the content of the document. Therefore it
doesn't make sense to find a <TT>&lt;H1&gt;</TT> within a list.

</P><P>
Character formatting tags also are generally not additive. For example,
you might expect that:

<PRE>    &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;some text&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
</PRE>

</P><P>
would produce bold-italic text. On some browsers it does; other browsers
interpret only the innermost tag.


<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>

</P><P>

<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    Validate Your Code</H4>
</P><P>
When you put a document on a Web server, be sure to check the formatting
and each link (including named anchors). Ideally you will have someone
else read through and comment on your file(s) before you consider a
document finished.

</P><P> You can run your coded files through one of several on-line <A
HREF="http://dir.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Information_and_Documentation/Data_Formats/HTML/Validation_and_Checkers/">HTML
validation services</A> that will tell you if your code conforms to
accepted HTML. If you are not sure your coding conforms to HTML
specifications, this can be a useful teaching tool. Fortunately the
service lets you select the level of conformance you want for your files
(i.e., strict, level 2, level 3). If you want to use some codes that are
not officially part of the HTML specifications, this latitude is helpful. 


<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    Dummy Images</H4>
</P><P>
When an <TT>&lt;IMG SRC&gt;</TT> tag points to an image that does not
exist, a dummy image is substituted by your browser software. When this
happens during your final review of your files, make sure that the
referenced image does in fact exist, that the hyperlink has the correct
information in the URL, and that the file permission is set
appropriately (world-readable). Then check online again!
</P><P>
<H4 ALIGN=LEFT>
    Update Your Files</H4>
</P><P>
If the contents of a file are static (such as a biography of George
Washington), no updating is probably needed. But for documents that are
time sensitive or covering a field that changes frequently, <B> remember
to update your documents!</B>
</P><P>
Updating is particularly important when the file contains information
such as a weekly schedule or a deadline for a program funding
announcement. Remove out-of-date files or note why something that
appears dated is still on a server (e.g., the program requirements will
remain the same for the next cycle so the file is still available as an
interim reference).

    Browsers Differ</H4>
</P><P>
Web browsers display HTML elements differently. Remember that not all
codes used in HTML files are interpreted by all browsers. Any code a
browser does not understand is usually ignored though.
</P><P>
You could spend a lot of time making your file "look perfect" using your
current browser. If you check that file using another browser, it will
likely display (a little or a lot) differently. Hence these words of
advice: code your files using correct HTML. Leave the interpreting to
the browsers and hope for the best.

    <A NAME="CO">Commenting Your Files</A></H4>
</P><P>
You might want to include comments in your HTML files. Comments in HTML
are like comments in a computer program--the text you enter is not used
by the browser in any formatting and is not directly viewable by the
reader just as computer program comments are not used and are not
viewable. The comments are accessible if a reader views the source file,
however.
</P><P>
Comments such as the name of the person updating a file, the software
and version used in creating a file, or the date that a minor edit was
made are the norm.
</P><P>
To include a comment, enter:
<PRE>    &lt;!-- <I>your comments here</I> --&gt;
</PRE>
You must include the exclamation mark and the hyphens as shown.
